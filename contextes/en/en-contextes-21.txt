25 of the Best Fantasy Books You Should Read Next

   [25bestfantasybooks.jpg]

   I know what it’s like: sometimes you finish a book and you just don’t
   know what to read next. That’s why I’ve put this list together of 25 of
   the best fantasy books (in no particular order) that should be at the
   top of your to-read list!

   And if you’re in the mood for science fiction instead, I’ve got a list
--

Assassin’s Apprentice

   Any list of the best fantasy books has to start with Assassin’s
   Apprentice! The beginning of the Farseer trilogy, and also the
   beginning of a nine book series that tells the life of Fitz, bastard
   son of a disgraced prince, and his remarkable, hidden role in history.

   Hobb’s Fitz books are very much a coming of age story, so if you’re a
   fan of tight action and lean prose, pass on this one. But if you like a
   fantasy book that enjoys its time with the world and it’s characters,
   take a look at Assassin’s Apprentice.

   Fitz is a great viewpoint character, flawed but full of good
--

A Sorcerer Slain

   If you liked the sound of a murder mystery in a fantasy novel, but
   didn’t really want a fantasy-Sherlock Holmes, then A Sorcerer Slain is
   for you. It’s funny, action-packed, and clever. And perhaps the
   greatest praise I can heap upon this book is that the lead character
   and investigator, Lowmar Dashiel, thinks like a real person.
--
   applaud every time.

   This smart writing extends to the genre blending that takes place in
   this novel. When I first heard that Sivers was writing fantasy crime,
   my first thought was that those genres were unusual bedfellows. But A
   Sorcerer Slain is proof they make an excellent match; it calls no
   attention to itself, borrowing tropes from both fantasy and crime as it
   wills. At no point do these genres clash, and most of the time they’re
   perfectly balanced.

   In fact, the only thing that lets down this novel is when those genres
   become unbalanced, and it embraces the fantasy genre too strongly. For
   instance, there’s a great battle which on paper sounds great for a
   fantasy novel. But this book is smaller, more intimate, and the battle
   felt out of place to me. Once things had got back to Dashiel’s smaller
   world, things felt more natural.

   So if epic fantasy is the only kind of fantasy you’ll entertain, give
   this one a pass. But if you’re in the mood for something a little
   different, this crime fantasy might just scratch that itch.

Children of Blood and Bone

   If you’re tired of medieval-European fantasy, this is an excellent
   choice for your next read. Adeyemi has written a story of persecution,
   magic, and raw emotion that will catch you by surprise at times. This
   might be a YA novel, but it doesn’t pull any punches; alongside the
--
   hinges on these conflicting desires that I honestly wasn’t sure which
   way the story was going to go, which is always a good thing!

   Filled with character-driven, action-filled fantasy that differs from
   the usual medieval-European fare, and unexpectedly moving at
   times, Children of Blood and Bone really is one of the best fantasy
   books out there.

   Or, give it a listen: I got a copy of the audiobook for Children of
--
The Lies of Locke Lamora

   I always think of The Lies of Locke Lamora as Ocean’s 11 meets epic
   fantasy. It’s not a perfect analogy; for instance, Scott Lynch’s novel
   doesn’t feature Don Cheadle gamely trying to squeeze as much Cockney
   rhyming slang into his dialogue as he can. But if you love a good heist
   but you like fantasy worlds too, this is the book for you.

   Locke Lamora is a member of the Gentlemen Bastards, a gang of thieves
   working under the leadership of Father Chains. They all find themselves
--

Redwall

   Brian Jacques’ Redwall is the first in an epic fantasy series for
   children starring English woodland animals. It’s quaint and it’s sweet
   and it’s fun. It’s a fantastic introduction to fantasy for children or,
   if you’re an adult, it’s a great read between thick fantasy tomes.

   The eponymous Redwall is an abbey, populated by mice, which faces the
   threat of Cluny the Scourge, the appropriately named rat leader of an
--
   There’s legendary warriors, an ancient sword, and riddles that will
   puzzle and please young minds (although quite how the logic works will
   puzzle older ones). Redwall should definitely be on your reading list,
   and is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy books around!

The Hobbit

   The Lord of the Rings gets all the hype and the glory, but I think The
   Hobbit is not just under-appreciated, but even (dare I say it) more
   deserving of a place on a list of the best fantasy books than it’s
   younger, bigger brother.

   Tolkien’s first major work benefits from being a sleeker, more focused
--
   decapitation of a goblin.

   The origin of golf sums up The Hobbit rather nicely, in fact. This is a
   fantasy adventure that isn’t meant to be taken too seriously. That
   doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high, or that there aren’t
   thrilling scenes and perilous moments. But this is fantasy without the
   grit and grime, so it’s perfect for when you need a spot of levity and
   adventure in your reading list.

Grendel

   This is a bit of a different one. If you like your fantasy full of
   adventure, give this one a miss. But if you’re in the mood for
   something contemplative, take a look at John C Gardner’s exploration of
   the monster Grendel.
--
   this book feels less like an exploration of a character, and more that
   the character is simply a vehicle for an exploration of philosophy. In
   fact, there were times when reading Grendel that I wondered if Gardner
   was simply using the tropes of fantasy to write a philosophical
   treatise. Which feels unfair, because even in those moments I found
   myself enjoying the story.

   But that, in a sense, is why I always recommend Grendel, because it’s
   by no definition a standard fantasy novel. I won’t lie to you: once
   you’ve read it, you might not want to read something like it again. But
   fantasy is such a huge, wide genre that can encompass so many different
   stories. Grendel is a contemplative fantasy, and it’s a masterclass in
   taking what was a fairly nondescript monster (from Beowulf, if you
   weren’t sure), and turning it into something you can not only empathise
   with, but end up rooting for.
--
   commits decent acts, although almost by accident.

   I was also somewhat surprised to discover that this wasn’t a medieval
   fantasy, but instead a fantasy set in a far-off, post-apocalyptic
   world. Lawrence does a very good job of weaving in hints of this world
   without being heavy-handed, which I appreciated; all too often, such a
   setting is handled with the subtlety of a brick to the face.
--
   Considering that much of Spiderlight feels like it’s based on D&D
   tropes, I was actually beginning to enjoy reading about the characters.
   This is a stand-alone novel, so there isn’t much room for the stakes to
   get to the usual dramatic heights of epic fantasy, but they felt high
   enough for an enjoyable read.

   And, while Spiderlight might not revolutionise the fantasy genre, I was
   too busy empathising with a creepy, giant spider to really notice.

Warbreaker
--
   What if you just want a taster to see if you like the author’s work
   before you dive in? Warbreaker is the taster you’ve been looking for.

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and
   such. I did, however, appreciate that the magic system creates what are
   essentially walking gods. One of them was even my favourite character;
   Lightsong is somewhat jaded and disconnected from his life of luxury,
--
   reinterpret its story and themes? Whatever it is, Frank Beddor
   certainly has a fresh take on things.

   Take Alice in Wonderland and put it in the epic fantasy blender.
   There’s a lost princess whose throne has been usurped, a kingdom under
   a tyrant’s rule, and an assassin; yes, the Mad Hatter has become the
   Hatter Madigan, and he’s a badass assassin now.

   There are certainly times where the story veers into epic fantasy
   cliches, but it’s almost a pleasure to see how Beddor twists the
   classic tale to fit the cliches. Unfortunately, it looks like this book
   is out of print, so you might have to hunt it down. I recommend you do.
   I had a lot of fun reading it and, if you enjoy epic fantasy and
   alternative takes on Alice, you will too.

The Broken Sword
--
   Published the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring (and therefore
   uninfluenced by Tolkien), The Broken Sword is a novel that has all the
   matter-of-fact grimness of Norse legends (and some of the characters
   and settings, too), whilst telling an epic fantasy tale in much less
   space than Tolkien ever managed it.

   The book tells the story of the son of Orm the Strong, Scafloc.
--
   of inevitable doom that comes from a culture whose philosophy ends with
   Ragnarok in which everyone dies (well, almost everyone).

   This is fantasy that isn’t inspired by Christian values or even
   traditional good vs evil narratives. If you’re the sort of person who
   enjoys the Norse mythology, this is a fantasy novel for you. And if
   you’re looking for something a little less spiritually uplifting than
   traditional fantasy, you should give this a go too.

Mort

--
   it’s sweet, and it’s full of clever observations of life that make you
   think a little too much, and laugh plenty.

   But the humour isn’t what makes this a great fantasy novel. It’s
   Pratchett’s inventiveness that does that. He likes to indulge in all
   the tropes of fantasy, and play and lampoon them in clever ways. For
   instance, magical rites are performed with plenty of pomp and ceremony,
   but Pratchett reveals that this is more to do with pride and
   professional prestige; most magic can be performed with very little
   indeed. I also liked the way Pratchett incorporated the idea of
   morphogenetics, ludicrous in real life but fascinating “science” for a
   fantasy novel. And, of course, the way Ankh-Morpork reflects every
   major city is always insightful and hilarious.

   But the truth is that I like this book so much because of Death. Of
--

A Game of Thrones

   If you’re someone who loves a grounded fantasy full of detail and lore
   that also feels like it could actually happen, the first book of the
   Song of Ice and Fire series is for you. You can understand why it takes
   George R R Martin so long to write one of these, because they’re packed
--
   But be warned: there are no happy endings in Westeros.

   One of the reasons A Game of Thrones has attracted so much attention is
   that it is a fantasy novel like no other. It is brutal, it is coarse,
   it is harsh and it has no remorse. Martin doesn’t tip-toe around the
   truth of the story. Characters have sex, get hurt, get maimed, and die.
   Love that character? They’re going to die. Hate that character? Well,
--
   it.

   But don’t let that put you off. This is certainly no straightforward
   adventure fantasy, and it’s a book that requires all of your attention
   to keep it straight in your mind. But I have never read a fantasy novel
   that felt so real and even as it threatens to confuse you with its
   complexity at every step, it develops in you a kind of Stockholm
   Syndrome. Even as the novel abuses your mind, you can’t help but start
--
   cynical with some dark humour mixed in. In fact, it’s hard to shake the
   feeling that this is the sort of book I should be writing…

   Rivers of London is an urban fantasy, telling the story of regular
   policeman Peter Grant who stumbles across the existence of a secret
   branch of the police that deals with the paranormal. A fairly standard
   urban fantasy plot so far. But the way Aaronovitch builds his world has
   a surprisingly Neil Gaiman-esque vibe to it; I saw surprising because
   of the humour that’s laced throughout the book. Seriously, if you ever
   needed a book called A Practical Guide to Sarcasm, this book would be a
--

   Still, the hype around this series is deserved. Even if you’re not a
   big fan of sarcasm, give it a read: I think you’ll agree it belongs on
   a list of the best fantasy books.

Truckers

--
   Ann Leckie is a phenomenal writer, and I try to hold off from buying
   her books because I devour them in a matter of days, leaving me left to
   wait until the next one is released. The Raven Tower is her first
   fantasy book and, while I have to admit it wasn’t as great as her
   Imperial Radch trilogy, it’s pretty great.

   One disclaimer, though: it’s written in the second person. Like
--

   One other warning: this is not a book if you want sword and sorcery and
   adventure. In fact, the book ends where many other authors would launch
   into the big meaty action scenes! This is a different kind of fantasy
   novel. It’s not without action. But it’s more cerebral. If you’re
   looking for a change of pace that’s brilliantly written, you can’t go
   wrong with The Raven Tower.
--
   disappoint.

   Lewis was a contemporary of Tolkien, and it shows: you won’t get gritty
   or grounded fantasy, but something far more allegorical. In fact, the
   Aslan/Jesus parallels are almost a little too on the nose at times, but
   you’ll let Lewis off the hook because Aslan is great. And if he’s a
   little too perfect, the White Witch is a little too frightening really.
--

Talion: Revenant

   Michael A Stackpole writes a fantastic line in late-80s fantasy
   fiction. It might seem quaint by comparison with the grittier fare that
   is modern fantasy, but it’s hard not to enjoy the way Stackpole romps
   through the story of Nolan, a young man training to be a Justice.

   Let’s be clear that this novel is not a weighty tome; it’s a fun,
--
   there’s plenty of action. Goblins and sorcerers, wood elves and the
   undead. This is a galloping blockbuster of a novel, and if it doesn’t
   require a lot of thought, it’s a lot of fun to read. Is that enough to
   warrant a place on a list of the best fantasy books? I think so. Not
   every fantasy book has to be a sprawling epic, a mighty trilogy, or an
   overwrought drama. Sometimes it’s just a fun piece of escapism, and
   Talion: Revenant is certainly that.

--
The Fey Man

   Don’t think I’m being egotistical and trying to include my own novel in
   a list of the best fantasy books! But it would be madness not to at
   least mention The Fey Man. Obviously I’m biased, but I think you’ll
   like it!

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and

   One other warning: this is not a book if you want sword and sorcery and
   adventure. In fact, the book ends where many other authors would launch
   into the big meaty action scenes! This is a different kind of fantasy
   novel. It’s not without action. But it’s more cerebral. If you’re
   looking for a change of pace that’s brilliantly written, you can’t go
   wrong with The Raven Tower.

   Lewis was a contemporary of Tolkien, and it shows: you won’t get gritty
   or grounded fantasy, but something far more allegorical. In fact, the
   Aslan/Jesus parallels are almost a little too on the nose at times, but
   you’ll let Lewis off the hook because Aslan is great. And if he’s a
   little too perfect, the White Witch is a little too frightening really.

Talion: Revenant

   Michael A Stackpole writes a fantastic line in late-80s fantasy
   fiction. It might seem quaint by comparison with the grittier fare that
   is modern fantasy, but it’s hard not to enjoy the way Stackpole romps

   Let’s be clear that this novel is not a weighty tome; it’s a fun,

   there’s plenty of action. Goblins and sorcerers, wood elves and the
   undead. This is a galloping blockbuster of a novel, and if it doesn’t
   require a lot of thought, it’s a lot of fun to read. Is that enough to
   warrant a place on a list of the best fantasy books? I think so. Not
   every fantasy book has to be a sprawling epic, a mighty trilogy, or an
   overwrought drama. Sometimes it’s just a fun piece of escapism, and
   Talion: Revenant is certainly that.

The Fey Man

   Don’t think I’m being egotistical and trying to include my own novel in
   a list of the best fantasy books! But it would be madness not to at
   least mention The Fey Man. Obviously I’m biased, but I think you’ll
   like it!
