27 Subgenres of Fantasy: Find the Perfect Books for You

   ByYvonne McArthur June 9, 2025July 1, 2025 Updated onJuly 1, 2025
   An array of fantasy novels are set up on pale wooden crates in front of
   a pale green wall, arfully arranged among clay candles, an olive wood
   bowl, a maple box, and miniscule walnut candles

   All lovers of the fantasy genre know that it’s a venture into the realm
   of the fantastic and offers a range of books as vast as the
   imagination. It encompasses everything from stories about teens on a
   magical quest in present-day Virginia to Parshendi bonding spren on one
   of the planets of the Cosmere. As a fantasy writer and obsessive reader
   of the genre, I think that’s awesome. But the genre’s huge scope also
   presents a problem: It is so varied that it becomes complicated to find
   books that match our tastes.

   That’s where the subgenres of fantasy come to the rescue.

   Imagine asking a friend about their eating preferences so you can
   invite them over for dinner and having them say something like, “Food
--
   Just as “Tex-Mex” and “Ethiopian” are sub-categories of food that give
   you a clear indication what kind of ingredients and spice profiles
   you’re in for, subgenres help us describe distinct flavors or
   sub-categories of fantasy.

   What do I mean by flavors? Well, if you like stories set in grim
   dystopian worlds full of monsters and spine-tingling chills, you might
   like dark fantasy. Whereas if you’re craving a nutty, off-the-wall tale
   that makes you laugh out loud, you’ll want to try comic fantasy.

   Think of subgenres as powerful search tools that help you find books to
   suit your tastes. For example, I love adventure and political fantasy,
   but don’t care for grimdark or romantasy. And last year, I found one of
   my new favorite books thanks to a subgenre list.

--
   each.

   If a subgenre sounds fun, jot it down, buy or borrow some of the books
   I recommend, and/or ask fantasy book clubs and communities for
   recommendations in the subgenres that pique your interest.

   Disclaimer: Think of subgenres as tags rather than boxes. Defining them
   is subjective. To borrow a line from Pirates of the Caribbean, these
   classifications are “more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual
   rules.” And just as a recipe can fall under “vegan” and “Thai” and
   “dessert”, fantasy books can be tagged under multiple subgenres.

1. High Fantasy

   Books that are high fantasy take place in completely different worlds
   from our own. Tolkien called these “secondary worlds.”

   They often include magic, mythical creatures, characters from different
--
   behind our present troubles and concerns, but we leave behind the world
   as we know it.

   High fantasy is, as Tolkien says in his essay “On Faerie Stories”, one
   of the hardest to write well because the farther we get from the rules
   and characteristics of our primary world, the more challenging it is to
   maintain an “inner consistency of reality”.
--

   I’m a fan. Can you tell?

   Examples of High Fantasy

   The Lord of the Rings is classic high fantasy. Tolkien’s Middle-earth
   is a world unto itself with a detailed and complex history, and over
   fourteen languages invented by Tolkien himself. There’s a good reason
   he’s called ‘the father of fantasy.’ Or, to riff on Brandon Sanderson,
   “Grandpa Tolkien.”

   My parents read The Lord of the Rings to me and my siblings when we
--
   where my love for the genre began.
   The wizard, Gandalf, in his flowing gray robes and pointed hat,
   striding through a blustery green meadow in the rain. The Lord of the
   Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is the signature example of the high fantasy
   subgenre. Gandalf the Gray from The Lord of the Rings—a classic example
   of high fantasy.

   Other high fantasy books I love include pretty much all of Brandon
   Sanderson’s books (I once read 25 of his books in one year.) The worlds
   he comes up with are unique, from the strange mists of Scadriel in The
   Mistborn Saga to the fascinating crustacean-inspired world of Roshar in

   Most of the audio versions are 50-60 hours—cue me listening at 1.75
   speed so I could finish before my library loan was due. But, Sanderson
   also has a short story collection called Arcanum Unbounded with one of
   my all-time-favorite short fantasy stories: The Emperor’s Soul. Start
   there for an intro.

   Beyond by Mercedes Lackey is another great high fantasy book.

   In YA, I’ve enjoyed the African-inspired world of Aritsar in Raybearer
   by Jordan Ifueko.
--
   story takes place in Nevermoor, a city in the First Pocket of the Free
   State.

2. Low Fantasy

   Standing in counterpoint to high fantasy, low fantasy is set in worlds
   much like our own. Low fantasy feels more grounded in reality, more
   familiar. It’s recognizable, but with a flair, a twist, something
   unexpected. It is our grandma’s shortbread with a swirl of lime zest
   and a burst of lavender flowers.

   In low fantasy, the world behaves like ours in some respects, but in
   others is shot through with the mystical, the supernatural, the
   magical. Often, the magic in these books is hidden or only accessible
   to a few people. Here we find secret societies, sentient libraries, and
   realms that are invisible to all but those who have eyes to see.

   Part of the appeal and delight of low fantasy is that the stories are
   about people much like us, with jobs and TVs and homework… but who
   encounter something fantastical: dangerous, scary, wild, enchanting,
   and almost plausible. It makes us feel like something magical could

   mica-encrusted stone and a gray and black feather. On the screen is the
   cover image of "The Raven Boys" by Maggie Stiefvater. It shows a crow,
   legs extended toward four grayed-out teen boys wearing matching
   jackets. The Raven Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy The Raven
   Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy

   Low Fantasy books often fit into other subgenres. Some common ones
   include modern, historical, urban, paranormal, and portal fantasy
   novels (which usually begin in the real world). More on those shortly.

   Examples of Low Fantasy

   The Harry Potter series contains aspects of low fantasy because every
   summer, Harry is forbidden from doing magic and is stuck in the
   non-magical, everyday world of regular Britain with his relatives.

--
   familiar but with the addition of ley lines, mythical Welsh kings, and
   dream magic.

3. Urban Fantasy

   Although it seems pretty darn obvious that urban fantasy books take
   place in—you guessed it—cities, not ALL fantasy books set in cities are
   urban. Yeah, it’s weird, I know. To be an urban fantasy, the book has
   to be set in a modern or modern-adjacent, real-world city, one where
   magic is hidden to all but a few.

   The key thing to remember is that urban fantasy is a subset of low
   fantasy. So even though The Lies of Locke Lamora takes place entirely
   in the city of Camorr, that city is not part of our world. Camorr is in
   a secondary (high fantasy) world. Thus… the book is not urban fantasy.

   Urban fantasy has a particular mystique. It’s dark with an edge of
   complexity that catches in the throat like molasses.

   Here we enter vampire lairs, solve mysteries, get lost in labyrinths,
--
   A book showing a picture of London and a train track disappearing
   underground sits in front of a dramatic painting of yellow and purple
   planet with a city of skyscrapers rising in front of it. Neverwhere is
   a great example of Urban Fantasy. Neil Gaiman’s Urban Fantasy,
   Neverwhere, is set in two versions of London: London Above and London
   Below.

   Examples of Urban Fantasy

   Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere is about a man from regular, real-world London
   who falls into the fantastical world of London Below. There, a girl
--

   Fun, right?

4. Epic Fantasy

   While the subgenres we’ve focused on so far are primarily defined by
   their setting, epic fantasy describes the story’s scope. Epics are
   epic. They are high-stakes adventures about characters who face
   overwhelming antagonistic forces: The Dark Lord Sauron with his
   far-seeing eye and hordes of orcs, immortal emperors who are impossible
--
   A carved blackwood elephant candlestick, a phone, and a tea candle
   inside a wooden holder are arranged in front of a blue, green, and gold
   scarf from Tanzania. The phone screen shows the cover image of
   "Raybearer" by Jordan Ifueko—an epic Afro-fantasy novel. Jordan
   Ifueko’s epic fantasy, Raybearer, covers sweeping world-changing events

   Usually, epic fantasies are also high fantasies, but not all high
   fantasies are epics. For example, The Goblin Emperor is a very personal
   story about one half-goblin’s unexpected rise to power and his personal
   and political struggles. It’s very much a high fantasy, but not an
   epic.

   Examples of Epic Fantasy

   By contrast, in The Lord of the Rings Frodo and Sam toil toward Mount
   Doom while Aragorn, Gandalf, and the men of Gondor draw Sauron’s eye
--
   domination. Epic.

   Sanderson’s Mistborn Saga and Stormlight Archives books also fall
   solidly under the epic fantasy subgenre, with the fate of the world
   (and the Cosmere itself) falling into the hands of the cast of
   characters.

   Likewise, in Raybearer, Tarisai is wrapped up in the politics of
   Aritsar, the fate of the empire, and of the world itself.

5. Adventure Fantasy

   Daring quests, intrepid explorers, action-packed escapades, and
   fantastic feats. Welcome to adventure fantasy, flavored with boldness,
   salted with heroics, and shot through with danger. I love this
   subgenre, probably because I love stories about journeys and wild lands
   and mythic beasts.
--
   until eventually, we prevail.
   A pen drawing of Smaug, the dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit",
   crouches over his hoard of treasure with a fierce expression. This is a
   great example of the adventure fantasy subgenre. The Hobbit is classic
   adventure fantasy

   Examples of Adventure Fantasy

   Adventure fantasies can be fun, high-flying, comedic tales like
   Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians or Howl’s Moving Castle or they could
--
   A note before going on:

   If there’s one thing you’ll notice on this literary foray, it’s that
   some subgenres of fantasy are broad, like massive umbrellas, while
   others are much tinier and more specific, like cocktail parasols.

   You’ll also notice (either here or in online bookish communities) that
--
   But don’t get lost in the fire swamp with Westley and Buttercup. You
   don’t need to memorize these names (unless you want to).

   My ultimate goal is to help you find fantasy books you like. That’s it.
   Discovering and loving The Moorchild matters a whole lot more than
   whether it’s better categorized as a mythic or fairytale fantasy.

6. Portal Fantasy

   Quick! Into the Wardrobe, past the thick fur coats, and onto the
   scrunch of snow. Look, there is a lantern shining in the woods, and
--
   travel through a portal or doorway into a magical world where they must
   adapt, confront dangers, and deal with magical forces.

   Portals merge the allure of low fantasy with high fantasy’s deep
   immersion into imaginary worlds. They bridge the magical and the
   completely ordinary. Perhaps one of us, by reading beautifully, could
   vanish into the Inkworld. And another could stare into the painting of
   a ship and be drawn suddenly aboard the Dawn Treader.

   Examples of Portal Fantasy

   My favorite portal fantasy is Enchantment by Orson Scott Card. It’s an
   adult fantasy about Ivan, a modern-day scholar who crosses a bridge
   into medieval Russia, where he meets a princess and must help her
   defeat Baba Yaga. Coming from a cross-cultural background, I love
   Card’s treatment of the cultural tensions and misunderstandings between
--
   The yellow cover of "Enchantment" appears through a circular lens. It
   shows a woman sleeping in a massive drift of leaves, surrounded by
   falling leaves and butterflies. This is a great example of a portal
   fantasy. “Now that she knew credit cards were valuable, Baba Yaga began
   to collect as many of them as she could.”
   ― Orson Scott Card, Enchantment

   One of the most well-known portal fantasy series is the Chronicles of
   Narnia by C.S. Lewis. In the first books, the Pevensie siblings travel
   through a magic wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they help
   defeat the White Witch.
--
   Cornelia Funke’s Inkheart series is a standby. What better way to enter
   a book world than through the power of language itself?

   Guy Gavriel Kay, another seminal fantasy author, wrote a portal fantasy
   trilogy called The Fionavar Tapestry. In the books, five university
   students from Toronto travel to the magical world of Fionavar, where
   they are caught up in a mythic conflict.

7. Political Fantasy

   Political fantasy books are about power and intrigue, the subtle
   machinations of governance, courts, empires, and countries. Despotic
   sorcerer kings, court scheming, military campaigns, and rebellious
   plots abound.
--

   Several of my favorite books fall under this umbrella.

   Examples of Political Fantasy

   The Goblin Emperor is a political fantasy through and through. So is
   The Queen’s Thief series (another favorite), especially The Queen of
   Attolia (book 2), The King of Attolia (book 3), and Return of the Thief
   (book six).
   Jewelry drapes across the cover of a book showing the profile of young
   man with a scarred face gripping a sword. This is one of my favorite
   political fantasy books. One of my all-time favorite political fantasy
   books

   Crown Duel, the second book in Sherwood Smith’s Crown Duel duet, is
   another of my political fantasy standbys. Spunky Meliara Astiar is
   probably the most unsubtle character you can ask for (her go-to
   behavior is to run at things with sticks and say whatever crosses her
   mind), so placing her at court leads to some fabulous mishaps.
--
   Series, and Guy Gavriel Kay’s The Sarantine Mosaic or standalone
   Tigana. All are excellent reads.

8. Dark Fantasy

   Darkness, monsters, death, gore, fear, and foreboding are common
   characteristics of this subgenre. The characters may be complex with
--
   it’s important to explore a state closer to reality.

   Confession time: this is a subgenre I’ve only dipped my toes into. Dark
   fantasy merges fantasy with horror, and horror is not my go-to vibe.
   But… I have read a few. It’s good to mix things up now and then. And
   some people love dark fantasy. You might too.
   A woman in a dark cloak with startling green eyes glares into the
   camera, while the left side of the image is obscured by the metallic
   blur of a knife. This is part of the cover of "Vespertine" by Margaret
   Rogerson. Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson is a young adult dark fantasy
   novel

   Examples of Dark Fantasy

   So, what dark fantasy books have I read and liked? Gideon the Ninth has
   a science fiction vibe and is about necromancers and their cavaliers
   (badass protectors) who have to solve a mystery in a decaying pocket
   world. The black humor and unique voice of the main character make this
   a standout book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, even if the
   blood, guts, and blobs of fat grossed me out.

   Vespertine is a young adult dark fantasy about Artemisia, a socially
   awkward teen with a traumatic past who has to defend her convent
   against the dead by wielding a relic possessed by a malevolent spirit.
   The setting is gritty, gray, and populated by corpses, but I enjoyed
   the character interactions, humorous breaks, and the snarky tone of the
   malevolent spirit.

   The Witcher is probably one of the most well-known dark fantasy series
   out there, with monster hunting, moral ambiguity, violence, corruption,
   and a grim yet likable antihero. Although I liked the stories, they do
   have explicit sexual content, which was a detractor for me.

9. Paranormal Fantasy

   Vampires, werewolves, warlocks, shadowhunters, demons, ghosts, and
   angels… It’s paranormal fantasy, popularized by the Twilight series
   (which, don’t shoot me, I haven’t read.) Paranormal fantasy is a subset
   of Urban fantasy, so they take place on our world, but are shot through
   with the supernatural.

   Here you might strike up an uneasy alliance with a vampire named
   Moriarty, learn to draw powerful runes in the fight against demons,
   speak with ghosts, and traverse energy lines in search of Welsh kings.

   Examples of Paranormal Fantasy

   Despite not reading Twilight, I have read and liked The Mortal
   Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Demon hunters in modern-day New
   York City, anyone?
   A woman holds a cell phone with a book cover on the screen. It shows a
   young man with runes pained on his arms surrounded by mythical lights.
   "City of Bones" by Cassandra Clare is a paranormal fantasy set in New
   York City. “What do you want?”
   “Just coffee. Black – like my soul.”
   ― Cassandra Clare, City of Bones
--
10. Romantasy

   All the rage these days, romantasy is a mashup of the romance and
   fantasy genres. The term is new, but fantasy romance books have been
   around a long time. So what exactly is romantasy? Well, as with lots of
   things in the literary world, definitions are subjective.

--

   Although sword and sorcery can take place in invented worlds, it
   focuses on the personal goals of one or two characters rather than the
   world-sweeping stakes and huge casts of characters of epic fantasy. The
   plots are straightforward, the technology is medieval as a rule, and
   the sorcery is usually nefarious.
   A thin albino figure leans against a tree, wielding a black sword, red
   eyes fierce. "Elric of Melniboné" by Michael Moorcock is a classic
   sword and sworcery, one of the subgenres of fantasy.

   Examples of Sword and Sorcery

--

   Books I’ve read in this subgenre include Elric of Melniboné by Michael
   Moorcock (one of the influential authors of sword and sorcery) and some
   of The Witcher books, which are also listed under dark fantasy.
   Granted, I didn’t love Elric of Melniboné, but that’s because the main
   character made choices that were so dumb I will happily rant about them
   for ten to twenty minutes.

12. Cozy Fantasy

   Have you noticed that certain subgenres are all about settings, others
   are about scope, and others are about plot devices or the presence of
--
   a book, and a plate of Welsh Griddle cakes while fog drifts past the
   windows. Some Christmas lights wouldn’t hurt.

   Cozy fantasy books embody the cozy vibe. They promise a certain kind of
   emotion: warmth, comfort, nothing too taxing, and are ultimately
   relational. The amount of conflict in a cozy can vary, but these books
   strive to maintain equilibrium between slice-of-life scenes and
   conflict.
   A book open on blankets and surrounded by fairy lights. This is an
   example of cozy fantasy.

   If you’re the kind of person who avoids books because you don’t want to
   stay up all night reading (a valid fear), cozy fantasy could be perfect
   for you. In my limited experience, they are easy to pick up, not too
   hard to put down, and sort of… peaceful.

   Examples of Cozy Fantasy

   I’ve barely dipped my toes into cozy fantasy, though I’m not opposed to
   reading more. The only book I’ve read so far that I’m sure lands in
   this subgenre has been C.J. Klune’s House on the Cerulean Sea.

--
   Sanderson’s Tress of the Emerald Sea, a whimsical tale of a girl who
   goes on a sea voyage to rescue her friend from an evil sorceress.

13. Mythic Fantasy

   Here be fairies, creatures you’ve only heard about around the campfire
   at night or from the strange old crone with an unusual herb garden and
   eyes that have seen more than you can ever know.

   Magic and myth mingle in mythic fantasy. Here you’ll encounter worlds
   populated by Greek and Roman gods, retellings of Norse myths, and
   series inspired by Slavic fairy tales.

   Books in this subgenre draw from the legends, folklore, and deities of
   cultures around the world, from the Aztecs to the Chinese to the Irish,
   and everything in between. Mythic fantasy offers fresh takes on
   familiar stories, as well as fascinating introductions to different
   worldviews and belief systems you may not have encountered before.
   An unearthly girl with while pale hair plays a bagpipe chanter. Part of
   the image is obscured by a spray of bright green fern. This is an
   example of the mythic fantasy subgenre. “Iron made her shiver, made her
   teeth ache and hurt her if she touched it.”
   The Moorchild by Eloise McGraw

   Examples of Mythic Fantasy

   One famous example of mythic fantasy is the Percy Jackson and the
   Olympians series. They are quite fun.

   Books I’ve loved in this subgenre include The Moorchild by Eloise
--
   probably fits in this genre as well, since Baba Yaga is the villain and
   there are several nods to Alexander the Great.

14. Historical Fantasy

   If you’ve ever wished you could go back in time and change a historical
   event, you might love historical fantasy.

   As you can guess, historical fantasy, much like historical fiction, is
   set during a particular historical period, and can involve real people,
   places, or events, but aside from that, pretty much anything goes.
   Magic, dragons, werewolves, battalions of sorcerers.
   A blue book with a white crackled mask and glints of fire sits on a
   blue couch. The title reads "Fawkes" by Nadine Brandes, an excellent
   example of a historical fantasy. Color magic and the Guy Fawke’s
   Gunpowder Plot meet in this young adult novel

   Examples of Historical Fiction

   There are different approaches to historical fantasy, which writer E.S.
   Foster explains as follows:

   1. Those that take place during a specific period in history, like
--
   reasons.

   3. Lastly, they can include stories that interact with the historical
   world and a fantasy world, but separately (like C.S. Lewis’ portal
   fantasy where the Pevensie children leave WWII England and travel to
   Narnia).

   If you enjoy viking stories with a strong focus on romance, you might
   enjoy Sky in the Deep by Adrienne Young.

15. Fairy Tale Fantasy

   Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named
   Cinderella. Unfortunately, her mother had passed away, leaving her
   alone with her selfish stepmother and stepsisters… cue the singing
   mice, fairy godmother, pumpkins, and glass slippers.

   Fairy tale fantasy includes classic fairy tales like Cinderella but
   also encompasses a whole realm of spinoffs, offshoots, and retellings.
   While mythic fantasy tends toward grandeur, I think of fairy tale
   fantasy as more grounded and whimsical, though they don’t necessarily
   have to be. Most of Grimm’s fairy tales are… well, grim.

   I enjoy the light reads and twists on familiar tales afforded by this
   subgenre.
   A hand holds a book in front of a branch of wood. The cover shows a
   black-haired girl with Mongolian features clutches a notebook. This is
   "Book of a Thousand Days" by Shannon Hale, a fairy-tale fantasy.

   Examples of Fairy Tale Fantasy

   For light fun reads that are very “fairy tale-esque”, check out Gail
   Carson Levine’s fairy-tale rewrites, including Ella Enchanted and
--
   secondary world inspired by Mongolia. How cool is that? I’ve read it
   many times, and it never gets old.

   Naomi Novik’s Spinning Silver is another fairy-tale fantasy worth
   checking out.

16. Nautical Fantasy

   Salty breezes, sinewy sea beasts, enchanted islands, pirates, and
   scrambling in the rigging—find it in nautical fantasy. If you’ve ever
   dreamed of sailing the high seas, felt the allure of the ocean, or
   wanted to dive for treasure, you’ll love this subgenre.

   I love nautical fantasy and need to find more books that take place at
   sea. The ocean is a world of its own, after all, full of dangers and
   the potential for high stakes conflict. Perhaps it has some cross-over
   with political fiction, too, since a ship at sea is a kingdom unto
   itself.

   Examples of Nautical Fantasy

   Here are a few of my favorites: The Liveship Traders series is a
   fantastic adult epic fantasy series about sentient ships, pirates,
   magic, and mystical islands.

   Although the first book in Sherwood Smith’s Inda series takes place on
--
   found them so engrossing that it was hard to sleep… so maybe read them
   when you’re on vacation.
   Three books in a row showing mythical ships. This is The Liveship
   Traders trilogy, excellent adult fantasy books about sentient ships and
   their human crew.

   For a less epic and more personal story, Brandon Sanderson’s standalone
--
   especially the more Caribbean vibe. Parts of the plot didn’t land for
   me, but it’s worth checking out if you enjoy young adult books.

17. Academy Fantasy/Dark Academia

   As you can guess by the name, academy fantasies take place in schools
   or academies.
--

   We’ve all been students, harped about homework, had teachers we didn’t
   get on with (and others we did), and had to muddle through exams.
   Academy fantasy takes the familiar world of academics and transports
   it, making it more awful or more fun, or at least more fantastical.

   For people still in the throes of studenthood, there is a resonance
   among the pages. For the rest of us, there’s recognition, the spark of
   old memories, maybe a modicum of nostalgia.

   Examples of Academy Fantasy

   I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the Harry Potter series here,
   which is the most famous example. (I reread these shortly before
--
   (Here be monsters)

   The Princess Academy by Shannon Hale is a light, fairytale-esque
   academy fantasy.

   Dark Academia is the gothic cousin of academy fantasy. I haven’t read
   many books in this subgenre, unless Magicians by Lev Grossman and The
   Atlas Six by Olivie Blake count. I didn’t care much for either, mostly
   because I didn’t like the characters, but I’m not opposed to trying
   other books of a similar flavor.

18. Roguish Fantasy

   Spies, thieves, pirates, assassins, and con artists let us live
   alternate lives, and you can find them all in roguish fantasy.

   These characters have often lived tough lives, been forced into morally
   compromised choices, or simply enjoy playing fast and loose with the
--
   outskirts, the world is against them, and maybe they are waging solo
   wars in the only ways they can.

   Examples of Roguish Fantasy

   If you love heist stories, check out the Riyria Revelations series by
   Michael J. Sullivan. They are my favorite books in this subgenre. Six
--
   well.
   Two cloaked figures with swords appear on the screen of a phone above
   the title "Theft of Swords." This is a fantastic heist novel in the
   roguish fantasy subgenre. Join two thieves in an edge-of-your-seat
   heist novel

   The Lies of Locke Lamora is a roguish fantasy revenge story about con
   men and thieves. (I’m not a big fan of revenge stories, but it was well
   done.)

--
   series by Sarah J. Maas, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, and An Ember in
   the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir.

19. Comic Fantasy

   We all need more laughter in our lives, and what better way to add a
   dose of endorphins than through comic fantasy? This subgenre
   encompasses the comedic, the light-hearted, the downright ridiculous,
   and the satirical.

--
   hints of the absurd, hilarious quips, and characters who bring tears of
   laughter to my eyes.

   Examples of Comic Fantasy

   Let’s all take our hats off to Sir Terry Pratchett. His Discworld
   novels are a universe unto themselves. I won’t go into which ones to
--
   his so far.
   Several exagerrated figures wearing sunglasses and enormous swords race
   across the screen of a phone, showing the cover of Alcatraz versus the
   Evil Librarians by Brandon Sanderson, a hilarious comic fantasy for
   middle-grade readers (pre-teen). “If you don’t believe what I’m telling
   you, then ask yourself this: would any decent, kind-hearted individual
   become a writer? Of course not.”

20. Medieval

   Knights, castles, swords, feudal systems, quests, serfs, bards, and
   overlords—find all these and more in medieval fantasy.

   If you’ve ever dreamed of snarfing down hunks of black bread, oiling
   your chain mail, jousting, or pilfering a lord’s pockets, the world of
   medieval fantasy has all this and more. There may be evil nights,
   dragons, magic swords, and dark lords.

   These books are set in the Middle Ages, or in worlds that resemble the
--
   technology.
   A woman in a black dress lifts a sword dramatically. This is the cover
   of "The Beauty of Darkness" the final book in "The Remnant Chronicles"
   by Mary E. Pearson. This is as example of medieval fantasy.

   Examples of Medieval Fantasy

   Lots of high fantasy books are Medieval, including The Lord of the
   Rings series, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, and the more
   recent The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

21. Gaslamp

   Are you craving the delicate manners and horse-drawn carriages of the
   Victorian era, plus or minus hoop skirts? Enter Gaslamp fantasy.

   This subgenre is all about Victorian-era vibes complete with historical
   settings, man servants, and strict standards of etiquette. These books

   A woman holds a phone with a black book cover dotted with white crows
   above a stylized city of London. The text reads "The Angel of the
   Crows," a gaslamp fantasy by Katherine Addison.

   Examples of Gaslamp Fantasy

   Some gaslamp fantasy novels I’ve read and enjoyed include The Infernal
   Devices series by Cassandra Clare (demon hunters in 1870s London), The
   Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison (paranormal Sherlock Holmes),
   and The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman (dragons and
--
   times I think it’d be fun to enter a world of clockwork machines,
   airships, and pneumatic tubes.

   Much like Gaslamp, steampunk fantasy is also inspired by Victorian-era
   settings, but the feel is less gothic and supernatural and more
   whimsical, adventurous, or dystopian. The technology in steampunk
   worlds can include airships, clockwork creatures or devices, steam
   technology, pneumatic tubes, goggles, and of course, some fantastical
   elements.

   Examples of Steampunk Fantasy

   I haven’t read a ton in this genre, but a series I enjoyed is Kenneth
   Oppel’s Airborn saga. It’s set in an alternate past with airships
   instead of airplanes. Protagonists Matt and Kate enjoy an airborne
   adventure that involves discovering fantasy creatures, combating
   pirates, and hunting for treasure.
   A cast iron teapot, an adjustable wrench, and black screws are arranged
   on concrete around a phone with the cover of book on the screen. It
   shows an airship and the title "Airborne" by Kenneth Oppel, a steampunk
   fantasy for middle grade readers. “Never climb a tree in a long dress,”
   Kate panted, coming up behind me.
   “I’ll remember that,” I said.”
   ― Kenneth Oppel, Airborn

23. Grimdark Fantasy

   Grimdark = Grim/powerless characters and dark worlds. One person cannot
   make a significant difference.

   Before we end… let’s chat about some additional subgenres you might
   encounter. These embody a certain ideal, and often, that ideal or
   worldview is written into the fabric of the fantasy world itself. They
   ask philosophical questions: Is the world ultimately dark or bright?
   Are we capable of effecting heroic change, or any change at all?

--

   Not so much to me, but it’s a popular subgenre.

   Examples of Grimdark Fantasy

   Although I haven’t read them, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and
   Fire is on all the Grimdark book lists I encountered while researching
--
   virtuous heroes prevail. Love, hope, and redemption win out through
   noble sacrifices.

   Examples of Noblebright Fantasy

   This term was coined by author C.J. Brightly, so if you’re interested
   in this subgenre, exploring her books is probably a good place to
   start. (I haven’t read her yet myself.)

   Much classic fantasy is considered noblebright, including The
   Chronicles of Narnia, The Chronicles of Prydain, and The Lord of the
   Rings.
   The distant figures of the Fellowship of the Ring make their way

   Examples of Hopepunk Fantasy

   As I mentioned in my intro, I found one of my favorite books thanks to
   the term “hopepunk,” so it’ll always hold a soft spot in my heart. That
--
   That, my friends, is the power of subgenres. And subgenre lists. And if
   you want to go even further, you can search for tropes as well.

   Katherine Addison. It is considered hopepunk fantasy by some. Me, with
   my obsessive re-read

Subgenres vs Tropes

   If we think of subgenres as sub-categories of fantasy with particular
   flavor profiles, (like Italian, Caribbean, or Chinese are
   sub-categories in the realm of cuisine), we can think of tropes as the
   common ingredients that we find across a wide range of novels.

   For example, the protagonists in many fantasy and young adult books are
   orphans. Because this story element is common across lots of books in
   the genre, it is considered a trope. And if it’s a trope you like, you
   can search for books with that particular story element (such as the
   dead parents trope common in young adult fantasy). Or, if you are
   up-to-your-ears in orphan books, you might prefer a book that doesn’t
   include that ingredient.

--

   I’m a big fan of the “found family” trope, so when I’m perusing book
   lists or asking for recommendations, I might say something like, “I
   would love to read a nautical adventure fantasy with found family and a
   forced proximity romance subplot.” And somebody might be able to
   recommend one to me.

   Cool, right?

   Check out my post on fantasy book tropes to learn to find books with
   ingredients you like.

FAQs

What genre is fantasy in the real world?

   Fantasy novels set in the real world are low fantasy. These stories
   take place in the real world, where magic is and other fantastical
   elements exist, but are often hidden. Additional subgenres in the real
   world include historical, gaslamp, steampunk, urban, and paranormal.

Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

   The subgenres of fantasy can be hard to define with exactness,
   especially as new ones emerge, fuse, and spark variations. But don’t
   stress about it. In the end, they’re nothing more than search terms to
   help us describe our reading preferences so we can find the books we
   like, recommend books to others, and discover new flavors of fantasy
   we’d like to try.

   Being able to say, “This book is a political steampunk-inspired high
   fantasy with personal stakes,” only matters if saying that inspires you
   to read it (or prevents you from reading it because you know you’d hate
   it).

   This list of five young adult fantasy series includes political
   fantasy, academy fantasy, mythic fantasy, epic dystopian high fantasy,
   and a western-inspired high fantasy adventure series:

27 Subgenres of Fantasy: Find the Perfect Books for You

   ByYvonne McArthur June 9, 2025July 1, 2025 Updated onJuly 1, 2025
   An array of fantasy novels are set up on pale wooden crates in front of
   a pale green wall, arfully arranged among clay candles, an olive wood
   bowl, a maple box, and miniscule walnut candles

   All lovers of the fantasy genre know that it’s a venture into the realm
   of the fantastic and offers a range of books as vast as the
   imagination. It encompasses everything from stories about teens on a
   magical quest in present-day Virginia to Parshendi bonding spren on one
   of the planets of the Cosmere. As a fantasy writer and obsessive reader
   of the genre, I think that’s awesome. But the genre’s huge scope also
   presents a problem: It is so varied that it becomes complicated to find
   books that match our tastes.

   That’s where the subgenres of fantasy come to the rescue.

   Imagine asking a friend about their eating preferences so you can
   invite them over for dinner and having them say something like, “Food
--
   Just as “Tex-Mex” and “Ethiopian” are sub-categories of food that give
   you a clear indication what kind of ingredients and spice profiles
   you’re in for, subgenres help us describe distinct flavors or
   sub-categories of fantasy.

   What do I mean by flavors? Well, if you like stories set in grim
   dystopian worlds full of monsters and spine-tingling chills, you might
   like dark fantasy. Whereas if you’re craving a nutty, off-the-wall tale
   that makes you laugh out loud, you’ll want to try comic fantasy.

   Think of subgenres as powerful search tools that help you find books to
   suit your tastes. For example, I love adventure and political fantasy,
   but don’t care for grimdark or romantasy. And last year, I found one of
   my new favorite books thanks to a subgenre list.

--
   each.

   If a subgenre sounds fun, jot it down, buy or borrow some of the books
   I recommend, and/or ask fantasy book clubs and communities for
   recommendations in the subgenres that pique your interest.

   Disclaimer: Think of subgenres as tags rather than boxes. Defining them
   is subjective. To borrow a line from Pirates of the Caribbean, these
   classifications are “more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual
   rules.” And just as a recipe can fall under “vegan” and “Thai” and
   “dessert”, fantasy books can be tagged under multiple subgenres.

     * Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

1. High Fantasy

   Books that are high fantasy take place in completely different worlds
   from our own. Tolkien called these “secondary worlds.”

   They often include magic, mythical creatures, characters from different
--
   behind our present troubles and concerns, but we leave behind the world
   as we know it.

   High fantasy is, as Tolkien says in his essay “On Faerie Stories”, one
   of the hardest to write well because the farther we get from the rules
   and characteristics of our primary world, the more challenging it is to
   maintain an “inner consistency of reality”.
--

   I’m a fan. Can you tell?

   Examples of High Fantasy

   The Lord of the Rings is classic high fantasy. Tolkien’s Middle-earth
   is a world unto itself with a detailed and complex history, and over
   fourteen languages invented by Tolkien himself. There’s a good reason
   he’s called ‘the father of fantasy.’ Or, to riff on Brandon Sanderson,
   “Grandpa Tolkien.”

   My parents read The Lord of the Rings to me and my siblings when we
--
   where my love for the genre began.
   The wizard, Gandalf, in his flowing gray robes and pointed hat,
   striding through a blustery green meadow in the rain. The Lord of the
   Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is the signature example of the high fantasy
   subgenre. Gandalf the Gray from The Lord of the Rings—a classic example
   of high fantasy.

   Other high fantasy books I love include pretty much all of Brandon
   Sanderson’s books (I once read 25 of his books in one year.) The worlds
   he comes up with are unique, from the strange mists of Scadriel in The
   Mistborn Saga to the fascinating crustacean-inspired world of Roshar in
--
   Most of the audio versions are 50-60 hours—cue me listening at 1.75
   speed so I could finish before my library loan was due. But, Sanderson
   also has a short story collection called Arcanum Unbounded with one of
   my all-time-favorite short fantasy stories: The Emperor’s Soul. Start
   there for an intro.

   Beyond by Mercedes Lackey is another great high fantasy book.

   In YA, I’ve enjoyed the African-inspired world of Aritsar in Raybearer
   by Jordan Ifueko.
--
   story takes place in Nevermoor, a city in the First Pocket of the Free
   State.

2. Low Fantasy

   Standing in counterpoint to high fantasy, low fantasy is set in worlds
   much like our own. Low fantasy feels more grounded in reality, more
   familiar. It’s recognizable, but with a flair, a twist, something
   unexpected. It is our grandma’s shortbread with a swirl of lime zest
   and a burst of lavender flowers.

   In low fantasy, the world behaves like ours in some respects, but in
   others is shot through with the mystical, the supernatural, the
   magical. Often, the magic in these books is hidden or only accessible
   to a few people. Here we find secret societies, sentient libraries, and
   realms that are invisible to all but those who have eyes to see.

   Part of the appeal and delight of low fantasy is that the stories are
   about people much like us, with jobs and TVs and homework… but who
   encounter something fantastical: dangerous, scary, wild, enchanting,
   and almost plausible. It makes us feel like something magical could

   mica-encrusted stone and a gray and black feather. On the screen is the
   cover image of "The Raven Boys" by Maggie Stiefvater. It shows a crow,
   legs extended toward four grayed-out teen boys wearing matching
   jackets. The Raven Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy The Raven
   Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy

   Low Fantasy books often fit into other subgenres. Some common ones
   include modern, historical, urban, paranormal, and portal fantasy
   novels (which usually begin in the real world). More on those shortly.

   Examples of Low Fantasy

   The Harry Potter series contains aspects of low fantasy because every
   summer, Harry is forbidden from doing magic and is stuck in the
   non-magical, everyday world of regular Britain with his relatives.

--
   familiar but with the addition of ley lines, mythical Welsh kings, and
   dream magic.

3. Urban Fantasy

   Although it seems pretty darn obvious that urban fantasy books take
   place in—you guessed it—cities, not ALL fantasy books set in cities are
   urban. Yeah, it’s weird, I know. To be an urban fantasy, the book has
   to be set in a modern or modern-adjacent, real-world city, one where
   magic is hidden to all but a few.

   The key thing to remember is that urban fantasy is a subset of low
   fantasy. So even though The Lies of Locke Lamora takes place entirely
   in the city of Camorr, that city is not part of our world. Camorr is in
   a secondary (high fantasy) world. Thus… the book is not urban fantasy.

   Urban fantasy has a particular mystique. It’s dark with an edge of
   complexity that catches in the throat like molasses.

   Here we enter vampire lairs, solve mysteries, get lost in labyrinths,
--
   A book showing a picture of London and a train track disappearing
   underground sits in front of a dramatic painting of yellow and purple
   planet with a city of skyscrapers rising in front of it. Neverwhere is
   a great example of Urban Fantasy. Neil Gaiman’s Urban Fantasy,
   Neverwhere, is set in two versions of London: London Above and London
   Below.

   Examples of Urban Fantasy

   Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere is about a man from regular, real-world London
   who falls into the fantastical world of London Below. There, a girl
--

   Fun, right?

4. Epic Fantasy

   While the subgenres we’ve focused on so far are primarily defined by
   their setting, epic fantasy describes the story’s scope. Epics are
   epic. They are high-stakes adventures about characters who face
   overwhelming antagonistic forces: The Dark Lord Sauron with his
   far-seeing eye and hordes of orcs, immortal emperors who are impossible
--
   A carved blackwood elephant candlestick, a phone, and a tea candle
   inside a wooden holder are arranged in front of a blue, green, and gold
   scarf from Tanzania. The phone screen shows the cover image of
   "Raybearer" by Jordan Ifueko—an epic Afro-fantasy novel. Jordan
   Ifueko’s epic fantasy, Raybearer, covers sweeping world-changing events

   Usually, epic fantasies are also high fantasies, but not all high
   fantasies are epics. For example, The Goblin Emperor is a very personal
   story about one half-goblin’s unexpected rise to power and his personal
   and political struggles. It’s very much a high fantasy, but not an
   epic.

   Examples of Epic Fantasy

   By contrast, in The Lord of the Rings Frodo and Sam toil toward Mount
   Doom while Aragorn, Gandalf, and the men of Gondor draw Sauron’s eye
--
   domination. Epic.

   Sanderson’s Mistborn Saga and Stormlight Archives books also fall
   solidly under the epic fantasy subgenre, with the fate of the world
   (and the Cosmere itself) falling into the hands of the cast of
   characters.

   Likewise, in Raybearer, Tarisai is wrapped up in the politics of
   Aritsar, the fate of the empire, and of the world itself.

5. Adventure Fantasy

   Daring quests, intrepid explorers, action-packed escapades, and
   fantastic feats. Welcome to adventure fantasy, flavored with boldness,
   salted with heroics, and shot through with danger. I love this
   subgenre, probably because I love stories about journeys and wild lands
   and mythic beasts.
--
   until eventually, we prevail.
   A pen drawing of Smaug, the dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit",
   crouches over his hoard of treasure with a fierce expression. This is a
   great example of the adventure fantasy subgenre. The Hobbit is classic
   adventure fantasy

   Examples of Adventure Fantasy

   Adventure fantasies can be fun, high-flying, comedic tales like
   Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians or Howl’s Moving Castle or they could
--
   A note before going on:

   If there’s one thing you’ll notice on this literary foray, it’s that
   some subgenres of fantasy are broad, like massive umbrellas, while
   others are much tinier and more specific, like cocktail parasols.

   You’ll also notice (either here or in online bookish communities) that
--
   But don’t get lost in the fire swamp with Westley and Buttercup. You
   don’t need to memorize these names (unless you want to).

   My ultimate goal is to help you find fantasy books you like. That’s it.
   Discovering and loving The Moorchild matters a whole lot more than
   whether it’s better categorized as a mythic or fairytale fantasy.

6. Portal Fantasy

   Quick! Into the Wardrobe, past the thick fur coats, and onto the
   scrunch of snow. Look, there is a lantern shining in the woods, and
--
   travel through a portal or doorway into a magical world where they must
   adapt, confront dangers, and deal with magical forces.

   Portals merge the allure of low fantasy with high fantasy’s deep
   immersion into imaginary worlds. They bridge the magical and the
   completely ordinary. Perhaps one of us, by reading beautifully, could
   vanish into the Inkworld. And another could stare into the painting of
   a ship and be drawn suddenly aboard the Dawn Treader.

   Examples of Portal Fantasy

   My favorite portal fantasy is Enchantment by Orson Scott Card. It’s an
   adult fantasy about Ivan, a modern-day scholar who crosses a bridge
   into medieval Russia, where he meets a princess and must help her
   defeat Baba Yaga. Coming from a cross-cultural background, I love
   Card’s treatment of the cultural tensions and misunderstandings between
--
   The yellow cover of "Enchantment" appears through a circular lens. It
   shows a woman sleeping in a massive drift of leaves, surrounded by
   falling leaves and butterflies. This is a great example of a portal
   fantasy. “Now that she knew credit cards were valuable, Baba Yaga began
   to collect as many of them as she could.”
   ― Orson Scott Card, Enchantment

   One of the most well-known portal fantasy series is the Chronicles of
   Narnia by C.S. Lewis. In the first books, the Pevensie siblings travel
   through a magic wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they help
   defeat the White Witch.
--
   Cornelia Funke’s Inkheart series is a standby. What better way to enter
   a book world than through the power of language itself?

   Guy Gavriel Kay, another seminal fantasy author, wrote a portal fantasy
   trilogy called The Fionavar Tapestry. In the books, five university
   students from Toronto travel to the magical world of Fionavar, where
   they are caught up in a mythic conflict.

7. Political Fantasy

   Political fantasy books are about power and intrigue, the subtle
   machinations of governance, courts, empires, and countries. Despotic
   sorcerer kings, court scheming, military campaigns, and rebellious
   plots abound.
--

   Several of my favorite books fall under this umbrella.

   Examples of Political Fantasy

   The Goblin Emperor is a political fantasy through and through. So is
   The Queen’s Thief series (another favorite), especially The Queen of
   Attolia (book 2), The King of Attolia (book 3), and Return of the Thief
   (book six).
   Jewelry drapes across the cover of a book showing the profile of young
   man with a scarred face gripping a sword. This is one of my favorite
   political fantasy books. One of my all-time favorite political fantasy
   books

   Crown Duel, the second book in Sherwood Smith’s Crown Duel duet, is
   another of my political fantasy standbys. Spunky Meliara Astiar is
   probably the most unsubtle character you can ask for (her go-to
   behavior is to run at things with sticks and say whatever crosses her
   mind), so placing her at court leads to some fabulous mishaps.
--
   Series, and Guy Gavriel Kay’s The Sarantine Mosaic or standalone
   Tigana. All are excellent reads.

8. Dark Fantasy

   Darkness, monsters, death, gore, fear, and foreboding are common
   characteristics of this subgenre. The characters may be complex with
--
   it’s important to explore a state closer to reality.

   Confession time: this is a subgenre I’ve only dipped my toes into. Dark
   fantasy merges fantasy with horror, and horror is not my go-to vibe.
   But… I have read a few. It’s good to mix things up now and then. And
   some people love dark fantasy. You might too.
   A woman in a dark cloak with startling green eyes glares into the
   camera, while the left side of the image is obscured by the metallic
   blur of a knife. This is part of the cover of "Vespertine" by Margaret
   Rogerson. Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson is a young adult dark fantasy
   novel

   Examples of Dark Fantasy

   So, what dark fantasy books have I read and liked? Gideon the Ninth has
   a science fiction vibe and is about necromancers and their cavaliers
   (badass protectors) who have to solve a mystery in a decaying pocket
   world. The black humor and unique voice of the main character make this
   a standout book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, even if the
   blood, guts, and blobs of fat grossed me out.

   Vespertine is a young adult dark fantasy about Artemisia, a socially
   awkward teen with a traumatic past who has to defend her convent
   against the dead by wielding a relic possessed by a malevolent spirit.
   The setting is gritty, gray, and populated by corpses, but I enjoyed
   the character interactions, humorous breaks, and the snarky tone of the
   malevolent spirit.

   The Witcher is probably one of the most well-known dark fantasy series
   out there, with monster hunting, moral ambiguity, violence, corruption,
   and a grim yet likable antihero. Although I liked the stories, they do
   have explicit sexual content, which was a detractor for me.

9. Paranormal Fantasy

   Vampires, werewolves, warlocks, shadowhunters, demons, ghosts, and
   angels… It’s paranormal fantasy, popularized by the Twilight series
   (which, don’t shoot me, I haven’t read.) Paranormal fantasy is a subset
   of Urban fantasy, so they take place on our world, but are shot through
   with the supernatural.

   Here you might strike up an uneasy alliance with a vampire named
   Moriarty, learn to draw powerful runes in the fight against demons,
   speak with ghosts, and traverse energy lines in search of Welsh kings.

   Examples of Paranormal Fantasy

   Despite not reading Twilight, I have read and liked The Mortal
   Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Demon hunters in modern-day New
   York City, anyone?
   A woman holds a cell phone with a book cover on the screen. It shows a
   young man with runes pained on his arms surrounded by mythical lights.
   "City of Bones" by Cassandra Clare is a paranormal fantasy set in New
   York City. “What do you want?”
   “Just coffee. Black – like my soul.”
   ― Cassandra Clare, City of Bones
--
10. Romantasy

   All the rage these days, romantasy is a mashup of the romance and
   fantasy genres. The term is new, but fantasy romance books have been
   around a long time. So what exactly is romantasy? Well, as with lots of
   things in the literary world, definitions are subjective.

--

   Although sword and sorcery can take place in invented worlds, it
   focuses on the personal goals of one or two characters rather than the
   world-sweeping stakes and huge casts of characters of epic fantasy. The
   plots are straightforward, the technology is medieval as a rule, and
   the sorcery is usually nefarious.
   A thin albino figure leans against a tree, wielding a black sword, red
   eyes fierce. "Elric of Melniboné" by Michael Moorcock is a classic
   sword and sworcery, one of the subgenres of fantasy.

   Examples of Sword and Sorcery

--

   Books I’ve read in this subgenre include Elric of Melniboné by Michael
   Moorcock (one of the influential authors of sword and sorcery) and some
   of The Witcher books, which are also listed under dark fantasy.
   Granted, I didn’t love Elric of Melniboné, but that’s because the main
   character made choices that were so dumb I will happily rant about them
   for ten to twenty minutes.

12. Cozy Fantasy

   Have you noticed that certain subgenres are all about settings, others
   are about scope, and others are about plot devices or the presence of
--
   a book, and a plate of Welsh Griddle cakes while fog drifts past the
   windows. Some Christmas lights wouldn’t hurt.

   Cozy fantasy books embody the cozy vibe. They promise a certain kind of
   emotion: warmth, comfort, nothing too taxing, and are ultimately
   relational. The amount of conflict in a cozy can vary, but these books
   strive to maintain equilibrium between slice-of-life scenes and
   conflict.
   A book open on blankets and surrounded by fairy lights. This is an
   example of cozy fantasy.

   If you’re the kind of person who avoids books because you don’t want to
   stay up all night reading (a valid fear), cozy fantasy could be perfect
   for you. In my limited experience, they are easy to pick up, not too
   hard to put down, and sort of… peaceful.

   Examples of Cozy Fantasy

   I’ve barely dipped my toes into cozy fantasy, though I’m not opposed to
   reading more. The only book I’ve read so far that I’m sure lands in
   this subgenre has been C.J. Klune’s House on the Cerulean Sea.

--
   Sanderson’s Tress of the Emerald Sea, a whimsical tale of a girl who
   goes on a sea voyage to rescue her friend from an evil sorceress.

13. Mythic Fantasy

   Here be fairies, creatures you’ve only heard about around the campfire
   at night or from the strange old crone with an unusual herb garden and
   eyes that have seen more than you can ever know.

   Magic and myth mingle in mythic fantasy. Here you’ll encounter worlds
   populated by Greek and Roman gods, retellings of Norse myths, and
   series inspired by Slavic fairy tales.

   Books in this subgenre draw from the legends, folklore, and deities of
   cultures around the world, from the Aztecs to the Chinese to the Irish,
   and everything in between. Mythic fantasy offers fresh takes on
   familiar stories, as well as fascinating introductions to different
   worldviews and belief systems you may not have encountered before.
   An unearthly girl with while pale hair plays a bagpipe chanter. Part of
   the image is obscured by a spray of bright green fern. This is an
   example of the mythic fantasy subgenre. “Iron made her shiver, made her
   teeth ache and hurt her if she touched it.”
   The Moorchild by Eloise McGraw

   Examples of Mythic Fantasy

   One famous example of mythic fantasy is the Percy Jackson and the
   Olympians series. They are quite fun.

   Books I’ve loved in this subgenre include The Moorchild by Eloise
--
   probably fits in this genre as well, since Baba Yaga is the villain and
   there are several nods to Alexander the Great.

14. Historical Fantasy

   If you’ve ever wished you could go back in time and change a historical
   event, you might love historical fantasy.

   As you can guess, historical fantasy, much like historical fiction, is
   set during a particular historical period, and can involve real people,
   places, or events, but aside from that, pretty much anything goes.
   Magic, dragons, werewolves, battalions of sorcerers.
   A blue book with a white crackled mask and glints of fire sits on a
   blue couch. The title reads "Fawkes" by Nadine Brandes, an excellent
   example of a historical fantasy. Color magic and the Guy Fawke’s
   Gunpowder Plot meet in this young adult novel

   Examples of Historical Fiction

   There are different approaches to historical fantasy, which writer E.S.
   Foster explains as follows:

   1. Those that take place during a specific period in history, like
--
   reasons.

   3. Lastly, they can include stories that interact with the historical
   world and a fantasy world, but separately (like C.S. Lewis’ portal
   fantasy where the Pevensie children leave WWII England and travel to
   Narnia).

   If you enjoy viking stories with a strong focus on romance, you might
   enjoy Sky in the Deep by Adrienne Young.

15. Fairy Tale Fantasy

   Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named
   Cinderella. Unfortunately, her mother had passed away, leaving her
   alone with her selfish stepmother and stepsisters… cue the singing
   mice, fairy godmother, pumpkins, and glass slippers.

   Fairy tale fantasy includes classic fairy tales like Cinderella but
   also encompasses a whole realm of spinoffs, offshoots, and retellings.
   While mythic fantasy tends toward grandeur, I think of fairy tale
   fantasy as more grounded and whimsical, though they don’t necessarily
   have to be. Most of Grimm’s fairy tales are… well, grim.

   I enjoy the light reads and twists on familiar tales afforded by this
   subgenre.
   A hand holds a book in front of a branch of wood. The cover shows a
   black-haired girl with Mongolian features clutches a notebook. This is
   "Book of a Thousand Days" by Shannon Hale, a fairy-tale fantasy.

   Examples of Fairy Tale Fantasy

   For light fun reads that are very “fairy tale-esque”, check out Gail
   Carson Levine’s fairy-tale rewrites, including Ella Enchanted and
--
   secondary world inspired by Mongolia. How cool is that? I’ve read it
   many times, and it never gets old.

   Naomi Novik’s Spinning Silver is another fairy-tale fantasy worth
   checking out.

16. Nautical Fantasy

   Salty breezes, sinewy sea beasts, enchanted islands, pirates, and
   scrambling in the rigging—find it in nautical fantasy. If you’ve ever
   dreamed of sailing the high seas, felt the allure of the ocean, or
   wanted to dive for treasure, you’ll love this subgenre.

   I love nautical fantasy and need to find more books that take place at
   sea. The ocean is a world of its own, after all, full of dangers and
   the potential for high stakes conflict. Perhaps it has some cross-over
   with political fiction, too, since a ship at sea is a kingdom unto
   itself.

   Examples of Nautical Fantasy

   Here are a few of my favorites: The Liveship Traders series is a
   fantastic adult epic fantasy series about sentient ships, pirates,
   magic, and mystical islands.

   Although the first book in Sherwood Smith’s Inda series takes place on
--
   found them so engrossing that it was hard to sleep… so maybe read them
   when you’re on vacation.
   Three books in a row showing mythical ships. This is The Liveship
   Traders trilogy, excellent adult fantasy books about sentient ships and
   their human crew.

   For a less epic and more personal story, Brandon Sanderson’s standalone
--
   especially the more Caribbean vibe. Parts of the plot didn’t land for
   me, but it’s worth checking out if you enjoy young adult books.

17. Academy Fantasy/Dark Academia

   As you can guess by the name, academy fantasies take place in schools
   or academies.
--

   We’ve all been students, harped about homework, had teachers we didn’t
   get on with (and others we did), and had to muddle through exams.
   Academy fantasy takes the familiar world of academics and transports
   it, making it more awful or more fun, or at least more fantastical.

   For people still in the throes of studenthood, there is a resonance
   among the pages. For the rest of us, there’s recognition, the spark of
   old memories, maybe a modicum of nostalgia.

   Examples of Academy Fantasy

   I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the Harry Potter series here,
   which is the most famous example. (I reread these shortly before
--
   (Here be monsters)

   The Princess Academy by Shannon Hale is a light, fairytale-esque
   academy fantasy.

   Dark Academia is the gothic cousin of academy fantasy. I haven’t read
   many books in this subgenre, unless Magicians by Lev Grossman and The
   Atlas Six by Olivie Blake count. I didn’t care much for either, mostly
   because I didn’t like the characters, but I’m not opposed to trying
   other books of a similar flavor.

18. Roguish Fantasy

   Spies, thieves, pirates, assassins, and con artists let us live
   alternate lives, and you can find them all in roguish fantasy.

   These characters have often lived tough lives, been forced into morally
   compromised choices, or simply enjoy playing fast and loose with the
--
   outskirts, the world is against them, and maybe they are waging solo
   wars in the only ways they can.

   Examples of Roguish Fantasy

   If you love heist stories, check out the Riyria Revelations series by
   Michael J. Sullivan. They are my favorite books in this subgenre. Six
--
   well.
   Two cloaked figures with swords appear on the screen of a phone above
   the title "Theft of Swords." This is a fantastic heist novel in the
   roguish fantasy subgenre. Join two thieves in an edge-of-your-seat
   heist novel

   The Lies of Locke Lamora is a roguish fantasy revenge story about con
   men and thieves. (I’m not a big fan of revenge stories, but it was well
   done.)

--
   series by Sarah J. Maas, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, and An Ember in
   the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir.

19. Comic Fantasy

   We all need more laughter in our lives, and what better way to add a
   dose of endorphins than through comic fantasy? This subgenre
   encompasses the comedic, the light-hearted, the downright ridiculous,
   and the satirical.

--
   hints of the absurd, hilarious quips, and characters who bring tears of
   laughter to my eyes.

   Examples of Comic Fantasy

   Let’s all take our hats off to Sir Terry Pratchett. His Discworld
   novels are a universe unto themselves. I won’t go into which ones to
--
   his so far.
   Several exagerrated figures wearing sunglasses and enormous swords race
   across the screen of a phone, showing the cover of Alcatraz versus the
   Evil Librarians by Brandon Sanderson, a hilarious comic fantasy for
   middle-grade readers (pre-teen). “If you don’t believe what I’m telling
   you, then ask yourself this: would any decent, kind-hearted individual
   become a writer? Of course not.”
--
20. Medieval

   Knights, castles, swords, feudal systems, quests, serfs, bards, and
   overlords—find all these and more in medieval fantasy.

   If you’ve ever dreamed of snarfing down hunks of black bread, oiling
   your chain mail, jousting, or pilfering a lord’s pockets, the world of
   medieval fantasy has all this and more. There may be evil nights,
   dragons, magic swords, and dark lords.

   These books are set in the Middle Ages, or in worlds that resemble the
--
   technology.
   A woman in a black dress lifts a sword dramatically. This is the cover
   of "The Beauty of Darkness" the final book in "The Remnant Chronicles"
   by Mary E. Pearson. This is as example of medieval fantasy.

   Examples of Medieval Fantasy

   Lots of high fantasy books are Medieval, including The Lord of the
   Rings series, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, and the more
   recent The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

--
21. Gaslamp

   Are you craving the delicate manners and horse-drawn carriages of the
   Victorian era, plus or minus hoop skirts? Enter Gaslamp fantasy.

   This subgenre is all about Victorian-era vibes complete with historical
   settings, man servants, and strict standards of etiquette. These books
--
   magic.
   A woman holds a phone with a black book cover dotted with white crows
   above a stylized city of London. The text reads "The Angel of the
   Crows," a gaslamp fantasy by Katherine Addison.

   Examples of Gaslamp Fantasy

   Some gaslamp fantasy novels I’ve read and enjoyed include The Infernal
   Devices series by Cassandra Clare (demon hunters in 1870s London), The
   Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison (paranormal Sherlock Holmes),
   and The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman (dragons and
--
   times I think it’d be fun to enter a world of clockwork machines,
   airships, and pneumatic tubes.

   Much like Gaslamp, steampunk fantasy is also inspired by Victorian-era
   settings, but the feel is less gothic and supernatural and more
   whimsical, adventurous, or dystopian. The technology in steampunk
   worlds can include airships, clockwork creatures or devices, steam
   technology, pneumatic tubes, goggles, and of course, some fantastical
   elements.

   Examples of Steampunk Fantasy

   I haven’t read a ton in this genre, but a series I enjoyed is Kenneth
   Oppel’s Airborn saga. It’s set in an alternate past with airships
   instead of airplanes. Protagonists Matt and Kate enjoy an airborne
   adventure that involves discovering fantasy creatures, combating
   pirates, and hunting for treasure.
   A cast iron teapot, an adjustable wrench, and black screws are arranged
   on concrete around a phone with the cover of book on the screen. It
   shows an airship and the title "Airborne" by Kenneth Oppel, a steampunk
   fantasy for middle grade readers. “Never climb a tree in a long dress,”
   Kate panted, coming up behind me.
   “I’ll remember that,” I said.”
   ― Kenneth Oppel, Airborn

23. Grimdark Fantasy

   Grimdark = Grim/powerless characters and dark worlds. One person cannot
   make a significant difference.

   Before we end… let’s chat about some additional subgenres you might
   encounter. These embody a certain ideal, and often, that ideal or
   worldview is written into the fabric of the fantasy world itself. They
   ask philosophical questions: Is the world ultimately dark or bright?
   Are we capable of effecting heroic change, or any change at all?

--

   Not so much to me, but it’s a popular subgenre.

   Examples of Grimdark Fantasy

   Although I haven’t read them, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and
   Fire is on all the Grimdark book lists I encountered while researching
--
   virtuous heroes prevail. Love, hope, and redemption win out through
   noble sacrifices.

   Examples of Noblebright Fantasy

   This term was coined by author C.J. Brightly, so if you’re interested
   in this subgenre, exploring her books is probably a good place to
   start. (I haven’t read her yet myself.)

   Much classic fantasy is considered noblebright, including The
   Chronicles of Narnia, The Chronicles of Prydain, and The Lord of the
   Rings.
   The distant figures of the Fellowship of the Ring make their way
--
   embraces hope. But maybe it’s just an edgier version of noblebright?

   Examples of Hopepunk Fantasy

   As I mentioned in my intro, I found one of my favorite books thanks to
   the term “hopepunk,” so it’ll always hold a soft spot in my heart. That
--
   That, my friends, is the power of subgenres. And subgenre lists. And if
   you want to go even further, you can search for tropes as well.
   Yvonne with one of her favorite books, "The Goblin Emperor" by
   Katherine Addison. It is considered hopepunk fantasy by some. Me, with
   my obsessive re-read

Subgenres vs Tropes

   If we think of subgenres as sub-categories of fantasy with particular
   flavor profiles, (like Italian, Caribbean, or Chinese are
   sub-categories in the realm of cuisine), we can think of tropes as the
   common ingredients that we find across a wide range of novels.

   For example, the protagonists in many fantasy and young adult books are
   orphans. Because this story element is common across lots of books in
   the genre, it is considered a trope. And if it’s a trope you like, you
   can search for books with that particular story element (such as the
   dead parents trope common in young adult fantasy). Or, if you are
   up-to-your-ears in orphan books, you might prefer a book that doesn’t
   include that ingredient.

--

   I’m a big fan of the “found family” trope, so when I’m perusing book
   lists or asking for recommendations, I might say something like, “I
   would love to read a nautical adventure fantasy with found family and a
   forced proximity romance subplot.” And somebody might be able to
   recommend one to me.

   Cool, right?

   Check out my post on fantasy book tropes to learn to find books with
   ingredients you like.

FAQs

What genre is fantasy in the real world?

   Fantasy novels set in the real world are low fantasy. These stories
   take place in the real world, where magic is and other fantastical
   elements exist, but are often hidden. Additional subgenres in the real
   world include historical, gaslamp, steampunk, urban, and paranormal.

Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

   The subgenres of fantasy can be hard to define with exactness,
   especially as new ones emerge, fuse, and spark variations. But don’t
   stress about it. In the end, they’re nothing more than search terms to
   help us describe our reading preferences so we can find the books we
   like, recommend books to others, and discover new flavors of fantasy
   we’d like to try.

   Being able to say, “This book is a political steampunk-inspired high
   fantasy with personal stakes,” only matters if saying that inspires you
   to read it (or prevents you from reading it because you know you’d hate
   it).

   An intro to some of my favorite subgenres:

   This list of five young adult fantasy series includes political
   fantasy, academy fantasy, mythic fantasy, epic dystopian high fantasy,
   and a western-inspired high fantasy adventure series:
