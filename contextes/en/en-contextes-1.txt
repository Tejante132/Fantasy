Fantasy Lyrics

   The lead single for Mariah’s Daydream album, this R&B song topped the
   US charts for eight consecutive weeks, and gained strong success
--
   Darlin', if you only knew
   All the things that flow through my mind
   [Chorus]
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
   (And I want you so badly)
   [Post-Chorus]
   Sha-do-do-do-do
--
   When you take me over
   Time and time and time again
   [Chorus]
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
   Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
   [Bridge]
   I'm in heaven
   With my boyfriend, my laughin' boyfriend
   There's no beginning and there is no end
   Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
   [Chorus]
   Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

     I had the melody idea for ‘Fantasy’ and I was listening to the radio
     and heard ‘Genius of Love,’ and I hadn’t heard it in a long time. It
     reminded me of growing up and listening to the radio and that
     feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea
     I had for ‘Fantasy.’ I initially told [co-writer] Dave Hall about
     the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were
     really into it.
