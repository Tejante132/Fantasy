Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone
--
   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach
--
   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each
   2 Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide examples of the
   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   two
   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   ment have been observed, differences in the specific fantasies that
   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   to

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-
   sions of the learning activity were significantly higher than the
   mean ranking of the no-fantasy version,

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the
   detective,
   the pirate, and
   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,
   and 27.6% chose the pirate, detective, and space ver-
   sions,

   lems to solve during four instructional sessions. In two fantasy
   conditions, the identical problems were presented within a fan-
   tasy problem-solving context. In one of these groups, children
   were given their choice of three alternative fantasy contexts; in

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   Even when the time that students

   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.
   Interestingly, these effects appeared equally strong, in the

   ity and appeal. Had the range of options included fantasies that
   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   the reminiscences of students discussed in the beginning of this

   been empirically documented in the studies reported herein
   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   citations, while Personality and Social Psychology emerged as the most
   influential source with 76 citations. Results show that although the
   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the
   detective,

   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   Even when the time that students

   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   citations, while Personality and Social Psychology emerged as the most

   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   Even when the time that students

   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   of

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs

   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

   American Psychological Association

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   of

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   (as

   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   of

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

   American Psychological Association

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   of

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   the reminiscences of students discussed in the beginning of this

   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   citations, while Personality and Social Psychology emerged as the most
   influential source with 76 citations. Results show that although the
   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

   American Psychological Association

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or

   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as

   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to

   of

   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
--
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
--
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   the reminiscences of students discussed in the beginning of this

   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.
