   If you love the fantasy genre (or want to explore it), add these
   classic fantasy books to your reading list! Perfect for fans of J. R.
   R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, most of these classic fantasy novels were
   written before Narnia and Middle Earth, and helped shape modern fantasy
   literature.

   Fantasy Novels (That Aren't The Lord of the Rings)" superimposed on
   top.

   I grew up steeped in fantasy literature, much of it either written by
   C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, or influenced in some way by those
   two authors. The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of
   Narnia are indeed seminal in the fantasy genre. But of course, Tolkien
   and Lewis were not the first fantasy authors on the scene, even though
   the genre was still pretty new when they were writing.

   If you’ve ever wanted to go beyond the borders of Narnia and Middle
   Earth and journey into other realms of fantasy literature, let this
   list be your guide! The first Narnia book (The Lion, the Witch, and the
   Wardrobe) was published in 1950, and the first installment of The Lord
   of the Rings was published in 1954 (although written earlier). Most of
   the books on this list of classic fantasy novels pre-date both of
   these! I hope you enjoy exploring the following authors and the worlds
   they created.

   and his imagination was baptized.

   MacDonald wrote Phantastes near the beginning of his literary career,
   and the fantasy novel Lilith near the end. Both have an amazing
   dream-like quality and are rich in symbolism. Although not connected
   they are excellent to read together, as they’re quite distinct from his
   more child-oriented fantasy novels such as The Princess and the Goblin.

   coveted textile and wallpaper patterns! As an artist, novelist, poet,
   bookmaker, and public speaker, Morris was quite the Renaissance man. In
   addition to The Wood Beyond the World, Morris wrote several other
   fantasy novels, the best of which is probably The Well at the World’s
   End. However, since The Well is much longer than The Wood Beyond the
   World, it makes sense to start with the latter, to get acclimated to
   Morris’s (intentionally) archaic style.

The Worm Ouroboros by E. R. Eddison (1922)

   The Worm Ouroboros is an epic high fantasy novel that tells of a
   sweeping war between the kingdoms of Demonland and Witchland. The
   conflict rages across land and sea, drawing in enemies and allies from
   neighbouring countries like Impland and Pixyland, as well as magical

   Although The King of Elfland’s Daughter is Dunsany’s best-known work,

Classic Fantasy Novels That Aren’t The Lord of the Rings

   If you love the fantasy genre (or want to explore it), add these
   classic fantasy books to your reading list! Perfect for fans of J. R.
   R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, most of these classic fantasy novels were
   written before Narnia and Middle Earth, and helped shape modern fantasy
   literature.
   Butterflies in a room backlit by a window, with the words "Classic
   Fantasy Novels (That Aren't The Lord of the Rings)" superimposed on
   top.

   I grew up steeped in fantasy literature, much of it either written by
   C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, or influenced in some way by those
   two authors. The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of
   Narnia are indeed seminal in the fantasy genre. But of course, Tolkien
   and Lewis were not the first fantasy authors on the scene, even though
   the genre was still pretty new when they were writing.

   If you’ve ever wanted to go beyond the borders of Narnia and Middle
   Earth and journey into other realms of fantasy literature, let this
   list be your guide! The first Narnia book (The Lion, the Witch, and the
   Wardrobe) was published in 1950, and the first installment of The Lord
   of the Rings was published in 1954 (although written earlier). Most of
   the books on this list of classic fantasy novels pre-date both of
   these! I hope you enjoy exploring the following authors and the worlds
   they created.

   and his imagination was baptized.

   MacDonald wrote Phantastes near the beginning of his literary career,
   and the fantasy novel Lilith near the end. Both have an amazing
   dream-like quality and are rich in symbolism. Although not connected
   they are excellent to read together, as they’re quite distinct from his
   more child-oriented fantasy novels such as The Princess and the Goblin.

   coveted textile and wallpaper patterns! As an artist, novelist, poet,

   addition to The Wood Beyond the World, Morris wrote several other
   fantasy novels, the best of which is probably The Well at the World’s
   End. However, since The Well is much longer than The Wood Beyond the
