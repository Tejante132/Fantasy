Top 10 Fantasy Book Series

   My Inspirations

   Written By Dominic Merrick

   Here is my list of favourite fantasy series. This list will not include
   a number of things. As with every list, this comes with a preface that
   these are my PERSONAL choices, completely idiosyncratic, with all my
   biases.
--

   The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny - really great concept and the
   plot is wild. It has some super world-building ideas and some of the
   most outlandish moments in fantasy. However, it suffers from mid-series
   lag, repetition of ideas and the characters are not so strong.

   Memory, Sorrow, Thorn by Tad Williams - classic with enough of a twist
   to make it different. The influences bleed out of this series, and it
   is steeped in fantasy tradition which is both a benefit and a downfall.
   It is saggy in many parts, including the first 200 pages of the first
   book, which is usually a fatal error. The prose is very strong and the
   cultures are interesting - ranging from Native American inspired to
--
   so-so world. Glokta the Crippled Torturer stands head and shoulders
   above all others. The plot is sometimes intriguing, sometimes
   predictable. The strongest standalone book for me is Red Country, a
   blend of fantasy and western, but nothing tops the First Law Trilogy so
   far. I met Mr Abercrombie for a book signing and he was a funny dude,
   he also helped with a research project I did at university. He is the
   first experience I had with ‘grimdark’ and probably the best with the
--

   So, maybe not a good start to include a series that is not yet
   finished, but the first three books are some of my favourite in
   fantasy. The world is vast and fantastically internally consistent, the
   plot is intricate and complex with so many brilliant twists that you
   wish you saw coming but you didn’t.

--
   has so many iconic titular characters. Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon, Jerry
   Cornelius, Michael Kane and Erekosé.

   The series has a revolutionary idea in fantasy, that existence is
   divided into two factions, LAW and CHAOS. And this has stuck with me
   throughout my writing career and bleeds into much of my work. Our hero
   fights for LAW, and is always a reincarnation of that Eternal Champion,
--

Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser by Fritz Leiber

   These short stories and novellas inspired my fantasy series, The Three
   Lovers, more than any other book. They follow the adventures of the
   titular characters in a sprawling fantasy city (Lanhkmar) and all the
   surrounding lands.

   There is a really great relationship between the two main characters,
--

   It really had everything, great plot, some of the strongest
   protagonists of all time, one of the most interesting and creative
   worlds in all fantasy, super twists and an unforgettable ending that
   keeps you thinking about it months after the fact. I can’t wait to go
   back and re-read the series, but I will wait a few years.

   It captured my heart and my imagination like no other series in recent
   years. Roland, Eddie and Susannah are some of the best characters in
   all fantasy fiction.

   It’s Stephen King at his wackiest and most creative, he throws
   everything into this series and I really do believe that it is his
--

Middle-earth by JRR Tolkien

   Lord of the Rings is the god of epic fantasy. Nothing has bettered it
   in terms of setting/world-building since its inception and I doubt they
   ever will.

--

   I’ve never come across something like it, so original in its approach,
   almost with a blatant disregard to storytelling norms, yet being
   grounded in European myth and fantasy so that it all works. Lyonesse is
   very difficult to describe, other than by saying it has everything you
   might recognise from European folklore but presented to you in a way
   you wouldn’t expect.
--

The Earthsea Cycle by Ursula K Le Guin

   When I look to how I want my first fantasy series to be, I want it to
   be like Le Guin’s Earthsea.

   I want it to have something potent to say about the themes of life,
--
   apprentice, to powerful master, to fading master and it is beautiful.

   I’ll leave the rest of my ramblings for a full review… but Earthsea is
   the Queen of Fantasy for me.

   Best Book - The Tombs of Atuan (#2)
