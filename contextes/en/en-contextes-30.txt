   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

--
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
--
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

--
   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
--
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
--
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
--
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
--
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.

   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
--
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
--
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
--
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

--
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
--
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

--
   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
--
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
--
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
--
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
--
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
--
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
--
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
--
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.
