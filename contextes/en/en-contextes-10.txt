2025 Fantasy Football: Week 15 Start ‘Em, Sit ‘Em, Picks And Busts

   Let’s dive into some news and notes around the league, my top fantasy
   plays and favorite picks for Week 15.

   Notes:

   • If you made it to the fantasy football playoffs, congratulations! If
   you did not, hopefully your league still has something to play for. If
   you finished in last place, take the punishment without any issues.

   • The injury bug was back in Week 15, and it could not have come at a
   worse time for fantasy owners. Daniel Jones is currently QB10 but is
   now out for the season with an Achilles injury. Jayden Daniels was a
   surprise return to the lineup for the Commanders but was forced out in
   the second half in Minnesota. CeeDee Lamb, Tee Higgins and De’Von
--
   his terrific career with a knee injury. As always, check my player
   rankings for the best available players.

   • The biggest unknown this time of the year is whether fantasy stars
   will get benched to rest for the playoffs. The Bills-Patriots matchup
   this weekend could have implications that could lead to this very
   scenario. This is something to keep a track of the next couple of
   weeks. It is plausible that Drake Maye is not an option for fantasy
   owners in Week 17.

   • Remember to check the weather heading into Sunday for your kicker

   Week 2: Zay Flowers remains the overall WR1 after torching the Browns
   (miss)
   Week 3: Daniel Jones makes it three straight weeks finishing as a
   top-five fantasy quarterback (miss)
   Week 4: Josh Allen accounts for five total touchdowns against the
   Saints (miss)
   Week 5: A tight end leads all FLEX-worthy players in scoring (miss)
--
   Week 13: Jaxon Smith-Njigba is held under 100 receiving yards (winner
   winner!)
   Week 14: Lamar Jackson gets back on track and finishes as a top-three
   fantasy quarterback against the Steelers (miss)
   Week 15: Nico Collins posts more than 150 receiving yards against the
   Cardinals
