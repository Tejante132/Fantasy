   Whether you’ve sat around waiting for your Hogwarts letter or looked
   for Narnia in the back of a closet, you've probably dreamt of stepping
   into your favorite fantasy books and leaving the real world behind. But
   the genre isn’t all witches, wardrobes, and whimsy! Beyond offering
   temporary escape from the pressures of daily life, the best fantasy
   books help us confront them.

   Stories of the otherworldly allow readers to make sense of this world,
   refracting change, wickedness, and heartache through a magical lens so
   we can see them all more clearly — and face them head-on. A good
   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!

   If you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of amazing fantasy books on

   quickly and get a personalized fantasy series recommendation 😉

   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition)
--
   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in
   Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike since it was
   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a
   momentous early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.

   The King of Elfland's Daughter

--
   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as
   one of the greatest writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award
   winner Jane Yolen to call him “the great grandfather of us all.”

   It might be a childhood favorite, but The Hobbit gives adult fantasy

   We all know what happens after King Arthur pulls the sword out of the
   stone; The Sword in the Stone takes a look at the before. Predictably,
   it’s much less glamorous. In this telling, the archetypical fantasy
   monarch was once just a boy called Wart — teased by his foster-brother
   Kay and subjected to a punishing round of lessons that would make any
   modern high-schooler wince in sympathy. Only Wart’s education doesn’t

   vacation spot suffers from bad leadership: it’s governed by a witch
   whose only policy decisions are about ensuring eternal winter with no
   Christmas cheer. The Pevensies have to oust her — with the help of a

   lion is a Christological stand-in, and that The Lion, the Witch, and
   the Wardrobe is a meditation on redemption, sacrifice, and faith. But

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   If you don’t think a rabbit warren could be reasonably described as

   With its elegant language and a thoughtfully rendered heroine, The

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust
   Pacific Northwest, in which the surviving humans have diverged into
   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science

   protagonist, a young black woman named Dana, finds herself flickering

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four
   elephants balanced on a turtle. The 41-book series is a world unto its
   own — and it all began with The Color of Magic. Pratchett conceived the
   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that
   saturated the market at the time. The result is playful-yet-thoughtful
   story about an incompetent wizard and a ignorant tourist, whose
   adventure reads like a hilarious, sparkling travelogue.

   Stories of the otherworldly allow readers to make sense of this world,
   refracting change, wickedness, and heartache through a magical lens so
   we can see them all more clearly — and face them head-on. A good
   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!

   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition)
--
   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in
   Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike since it was
   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a
   momentous early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.

   The King of Elfland's Daughter

--
   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as
   one of the greatest writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award
   winner Jane Yolen to call him “the great grandfather of us all.”

   We all know what happens after King Arthur pulls the sword out of the
   stone; The Sword in the Stone takes a look at the before. Predictably,
   it’s much less glamorous. In this telling, the archetypical fantasy
   monarch was once just a boy called Wart — teased by his foster-brother
   Kay and subjected to a punishing round of lessons that would make any

   lion is a Christological stand-in, and that The Lion, the Witch, and

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust
   Pacific Northwest, in which the surviving humans have diverged into
   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science

   protagonist, a young black woman named Dana, finds herself flickering

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four
   elephants balanced on a turtle. The 41-book series is a world unto its

   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that
   saturated the market at the time. The result is playful-yet-thoughtful
   story about an incompetent wizard and a ignorant tourist, whose
   adventure reads like a hilarious, sparkling travelogue.

   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!

   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition)
--
   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in
   Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike since it was
   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a
   momentous early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.

   The King of Elfland's Daughter

--
   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as
   one of the greatest writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award
   winner Jane Yolen to call him “the great grandfather of us all.”

   We all know what happens after King Arthur pulls the sword out of the
   stone; The Sword in the Stone takes a look at the before. Predictably,
   it’s much less glamorous. In this telling, the archetypical fantasy
   monarch was once just a boy called Wart — teased by his foster-brother
   Kay and subjected to a punishing round of lessons that would make any

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust
   Pacific Northwest, in which the surviving humans have diverged into
   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four
   elephants balanced on a turtle. The 41-book series is a world unto its

   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that

   story about an incompetent wizard and a ignorant tourist, whose

   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition)
--
   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in
   Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike since it was
   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a
   momentous early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.

   The King of Elfland's Daughter

   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as
   one of the greatest writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award
   winner Jane Yolen to call him “the great grandfather of us all.”

   We all know what happens after King Arthur pulls the sword out of the

   it’s much less glamorous. In this telling, the archetypical fantasy
   monarch was once just a boy called Wart — teased by his foster-brother
   Kay and subjected to a punishing round of lessons that would make any

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust
   Pacific Northwest, in which the surviving humans have diverged into
   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four

   Whether you’ve sat around waiting for your Hogwarts letter or looked
   for Narnia in the back of a closet, you've probably dreamt of stepping
   into your favorite fantasy books and leaving the real world behind. But
   the genre isn’t all witches, wardrobes, and whimsy! Beyond offering
   temporary escape from the pressures of daily life, the best fantasy
   books help us confront them.

   Stories of the otherworldly allow readers to make sense of this world,
   refracting change, wickedness, and heartache through a magical lens so
   we can see them all more clearly — and face them head-on. A good
   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!
