Gardens of the Moon by Steven Eriskon – 657 pages

   Tommye from The Fantasy Review: “Gardens of the Moon is one of the
   best fantasy books I have ever read. The world is rich and its history
   angry and proud. Steven Erikson’s first book in Malazan Book of the
   Fallen is a masterpiece.”

The Dragonbone Chair – 672 pages

   FantasyBookReview: “This is epic fantasy, nearly 800 pages of it and it
   lasts the pace well. The Dragonbone Chair brings together all the
   elements that are found in many a fantasy book and re-produces them in
   a beautiful and endearing way.”

Royal Assassin – 675 pages (Assassin’s Quest is even bigger at 869 pages)
--

Theft of Swords – 691 pages

   Nils Shukla for The Fantasy Hive: “Theft of Swords really embodies the
   high fantasy genre, it includes organically likable characters and a
   world so wonderfully layered there is always more to uncover”

The Lies of Locke Lamora – 752 pages

   Matt’s Fantasy Book Reviews: “This is a fantastic fantasy novel that I
   happily can say is in my “top 10”.
   I loved everything about this book. The characters are wonderfully
   written, the world is thoroughly enjoyable (even though it’s on a very

   can horrify you one minute and then touch every heartstring in your
   being the next. That’s an incredibly tricky thing to pull off but
   Ardalan does it like a skilled maestro. If you’re tired of getting
   spoon-fed the same predictable tropes in your fantasy books, you really
   should make this book your next read. It will challenge you in a way
   that not too many fantasy books dare to. And along the way you will be
   treated to some outstanding worldbuilding, egotistical gods, magical
   creatures born of nightmares, and some of the very best writing out
   there.”

   I maintain that not only is Game of Thrones a brilliant read, it’s also
   an important one for the genre. It’s meaningful to talk about post-GRRM
   fantasy.

   For many people, indeed for a decent chunk of a whole. generation of
   fantasy authors, George RR Martin’s A Game of Thrones was a step change
   in the genre.”

   James Tivendale for Grimdark Magazine: “The Priory of the Orange Tree
   is incredibly detailed, neatly composed and has more stunning
   set-pieces, outstanding moments and unexpected twists that most epic
   fantasy trilogies.”

Master Artificer – 866 pages
--
   putting you right into the thick of it! It’s action packed, intense,
   full of fury and rage, with perfectly timed humor. It has a gritty
   darkness to it, but above all else it has a message of hope, a perfect
   marriage of both dark and light fantasy that can only be described as
   GrimHeart.”

   PL Stuart for Before We Go Blog: “This book far exceeds the nominal
   five star rating, so no point in trying to assign it one here. The best
   compliment I can give Dragon Mage, by M.L. Spencer is: Dragon Mage is
   why I read, and love, epic fantasy.”

The Way of Kings – 1007 pages
--
Ash: A Secret History – 1632 pages

   “The first thing that should probably be said about Ash: A Secret
   History is that it’s probably the apex of the epic fantasy genre – or
   at least, the best thing written in the genre since The Lord of the
   Rings” – Goodreads review from Wastrel
