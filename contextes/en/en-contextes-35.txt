   The Fantasy for piano, vocal soloists, mixed chorus, and orchestra,
   Op. 80, usually called the Choral Fantasy, was composed in 1808 by then
   38-year-old Ludwig van Beethoven.

   Beethoven intended the Fantasy to serve as the concluding work for the
   benefit concert he put on for himself on 22 December 1808; the
   performers consisted of vocal soloists, mixed chorus, an orchestra, and
   Beethoven himself as piano soloist. The Fantasy was designed to include
   all the participants in the program and thus unites all of these
   musical forces.

   share essentially the same harmonic sequence at their climactic
   moments, the chords (in C major) C–F–D–(G)–E♭, where the E♭ stands out
   from its harmonic context and is performed fortissimo. The words sung
   at this point are (for the Choral Fantasy) "Lieb und Kraft" ("love and
   strength") and (for the Ninth Symphony) "Über'm Sternenzelt! Über
   Sternen muss er wohnen." ("Above the tent of the stars, above the stars
   he must dwell.")^[7]

   There are also affinities in the texts. The theme of the Choral Fantasy
   text – universal fraternity with the meeting of arts – evokes similar
   feelings as the "Ode to Joy" text.

   The Choral Fantasy theme is itself taken from an earlier work by
   Beethoven: it is a slightly modified version of the composer's "Seufzer
   eines Ungeliebten – Gegenliebe,” a lied for high voice and piano
   written c. 1794–1795.^[9]
