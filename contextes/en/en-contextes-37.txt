Music and Fantasy in Perfect Harmony

   By William Blanc

   In films or novels, music accompanies fantasy everywhere. Many
   composers, in turn, have immersed themselves in the genre, from film
   music to rock, rap and metal.

--
   wandering minstrel, as the "Troubadour Style" spread to painting in
   19th-century France. We also find ballad in the noun "baladine", a
   traveller whom the reader accompanies to a faraway, imaginary and
   enchanted universe. So it is not surprising that fantasy, heir
   to English medievalism, is a genre imbued with music.

   <i>The Minstrel</i>, drawing by François Grenier and Jules Davod,

   and Songs of Middle Earth, in which we hear not only Tolkien reciting
   some of his verses, but also interpretations of his songs by an opera
   singer, William Elvin. This record was one of the first examples of
   multimedia fantasy creation, where, in response to demand by curious
   fans, sound and visual elements are added to a literary fantasy world
   (illustrations, notably through calendars), a process that naturally
   leads to the staging of film or television versions.

Progressive Rock and Counterculture

   As a genre full of references to music, fantasy would quickly influence
   composers, particularly those of the protest generation of the 1960s,
   who saw in Tolkien's works, and more broadly in magical medievalism, an
   instrument for criticizing the contemporary industrial and military

   But it was progressive rock musicians who would draw their inspiration
   from fantasy the most. This musical genre is constructed like a
   psychedelic journey far from contemporary reality, a "trip" often
   triggered by the use of hallucinogenic drugs. It is thus made up of
   long pieces evoking imaginary worlds. The title of leading progressive
   rock band Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
   (1967), was a direct reference to Kenneth Grahame's youth fantasy novel
   The Wind in the Willows (1908). The characters in the story,
   anthropomorphic animals, see the god Pan playing a piece on his flute
   at dawn. This scene, a favorite of Sid Barrett, singer of Pink Floyd

   The popularity of magical themes in progressive rock would later
   inspire metal musicians and songwriters, who like fantasy writers,
   plunge their audience into a medieval fantasy world.

   Music

Symphony and Epic Music

   At the same time, fantasy quickly began producing original tracks,
   especially for feature films and associated video games. Many of these
   works resembled compositions for opera, especially those by Richard
   Wagner, which are still a reference today, or for symphony orchestras,
--
   classical orchestra, and toured the world several times to celebrate
   the game's 25th anniversary. This phenomenon shows both the fascination
   of an audience of adult fans for the adventurous and imaginary ballads
   of their childhood, but also the increasing acceptance of fantasy in
   society. Thereafter, these productions were performed in symphony halls
   that are more associated with a legitimate, bourgeois and learned
   culture.

   The popularity of fantasy at the beginning of the 21st century
   continued to influence artists in popular musical genres, especially in
   those who until then had taken little inspiration from medieval magic.
   This imaginary world referred to a theme that was too "Europe-centered"

   hip-hop artists and rappers, such as the Wu-Tang Clan with their album
   Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) released in 1993, or the French artist
   Shurik'N with his song "Samurai" (1998). This music quickly became
   imbued with fantasy and albums, such as L'École du micro d'argent
   (1997) by the French group IAM, made direct reference to the genre.
   Shortly after the release of the Game of Thrones series, this
   fascination led to the publication on the Internet of two mixtapes

   a song composed by Sofiane, a rapper from Stains in Seine-Saint-Denis.
   Accompanying the French release of Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of
   the Sword (2017) (a version of the Camelot myth strongly marked by
   fantasy), the song begins as follows: "Lift up the street, as you would
   lift up the Grail".
