   Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction that involves supernatural or
   magical elements, often including completely imaginary realms and
   creatures.^[1]^[2]

   The genre's roots lie in fantasy literature and drama. From the
   twentieth century onward, it has expanded into various media, including
   film, television, graphic novels, manga, animation, and video games.

   Anglophone literary critics.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] An archaic spelling for
   the term is phantasy.^[7]

   Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction
   and horror by an absence of scientific or macabre themes, although
   these can occur in fantasy. In popular culture, the fantasy genre
   predominantly features settings that reflect the actual Earth, but with
   some sense of otherness.^[8]

   Many works of fantasy use magic or other supernatural elements as a
   main plot element, theme, or setting.^[9] Magic, magic practitioners
   (sorcerers, witches and so on) and magical creatures are common in many
   of these worlds.^[7]

   An identifying trait of fantasy is the author's use of narrative
   elements that do not have to rely on history or nature to be
   coherent.^[10] This differs from realistic fiction in that realistic
   fiction has to attend to the history and natural laws of reality, where
   fantasy does not. In writing fantasy the author uses worldbuilding to
   create characters, situations, and settings that may not be possible in
   reality.

   Many fantasy authors use real-world folklore and mythology as
   inspiration;^[11] and although another defining characteristic of the
   fantasy genre is the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as
   magic,^[12] this does not have to be the case.

   Fantasy has often been compared to science fiction and horror because
   they are the major categories of speculative fiction. Fantasy is
   distinguished from science fiction by the plausibility of the narrative
   elements. A science fiction narrative is unlikely, though seemingly
   possible through logical scientific or technological extrapolation,
   where fantasy narratives do not need to be scientifically
   possible.^[10] Authors have to rely on the readers' suspension of
   disbelief, an acceptance of the unbelievable or impossible for the sake
   of enjoyment, in order to write effective fantasies. Despite both
   genres' heavy reliance on the supernatural, fantasy and horror are
   distinguishable from one another. Horror primarily evokes fear through
   the protagonists' weaknesses or inability to deal with the
   antagonists.^[13]

   While elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were part of
   literature from its beginning, fantasy elements also occur throughout
   ancient religious texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh.^[14] The ancient
   Babylonian creation epic, the Enûma Eliš, in which the god Marduk slays
   the goddess Tiamat,^[15] reflects the theme of cosmic conflict between
   good and evil, which is characteristic of the modern fantasy
   genre.^[15] Genres of romantic and fantasy literature also existed in
   ancient Egypt.^[16] The Tales of the Court of King Khufu, which is
   preserved in the Westcar Papyrus and was probably written in the middle
   of the second half of the eighteenth century BC, preserves a mixture of
   stories with elements of historical fiction, fantasy, and
   satire.^[17]^[18] Egyptian funerary texts preserve mythological
   tales,^[16] the most significant of which are the myths of Osiris and
   his son Horus.^[16]
--
   which an Athenian man persuades the world's birds to build a city in
   the clouds and thereby challenges Zeus's authority.^[20] Ovid's
   Metamorphoses and Apuleius's The Golden Ass are both works that
   influenced the development of the fantasy genre^[20] by taking mythic
   elements and weaving them into personal accounts.^[20] Both works
   involve complex narratives in which humans beings are transformed into
   animals or inanimate objects.^[20] Platonic teachings and early
   Christian theology are major influences on the modern fantasy
   genre.^[20] Plato used allegories to convey many of his teachings,^[20]
   and early Christian writers interpreted both the Old and New Testaments
   as employing parables to convey spiritual truths.^[20] This ability to
   find meaning in a story that is not literally true became the
   foundation for developing the modern fantasy genre.^[20]

   Islamic, Hindu, and Chinese sources contain fantasy elements as well.
   The best-known fiction from the Islamic world is One Thousand and One
   Nights (The Arabian Nights), which is a compilation of ancient and
   medieval folk tales. Various characters from this epic have become
--
   particularly in the Indian epics. The Panchatantra (Fables of Bidpai),
   for example, used animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the
   central Indian principles of political science. Chinese traditions have
   been particularly influential in the vein of fantasy known as
   Chinoiserie, which includes such writers as Ernest Bramah and Barry
   Hughart.^[21]

   Beowulf is among the best known of the Old English tales in the
   English-speaking world, and it has deeply influenced the fantasy genre;
   several fantasy works have retold the story, for example, John
   Gardner's novel Grendel.^[22] Norse mythology, as found in the Elder
   Edda and Younger Edda collections, includes such figures as the god
   Odin and his fellow Aesir, in addition to dwarves, elves, dragons, and
   giants.^[23] These elements have been directly imported into various
   fantasy works. The distinct folklores of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland
   have sometimes been used indiscriminately for "Celtic" fantasy,
   sometimes with great success; other writers have specified the use of a
   single source.^[24] The Welsh tradition has been particularly
   influential, because of its connection to the legendary King Arthur and
   its collection into a single work, the epic Mabinogion.^[24]

   There are many works where the boundary between fantasy and other
   genres is unclear: did the writers believe in the possibility of the
   marvels in the play A Midsummer Night's Dream or the romance in Sir
   Gawain and the Green Knight? This question makes it difficult to
   distinguish when fantasy began, in its modern sense.^[25]

Modern fantasy

   [edit]

   and the Goblin

   Although pre-dated by John Ruskin's story The King of the Golden River
   (1841), the history of modern fantasy literature is usually said to
   begin with George MacDonald, the Scottish author of such novels as
   Phantastes (1858) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872); the former is
   widely considered to be the first fantasy novel ever written for
   adults. MacDonald was a major influence on both J. R. R. Tolkien and C.
   S. Lewis.^[26] The other major fantasy author of this era was William
   Morris, an English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of
   the century, including The Wood Beyond the World (1894) and The Well at
   the World's End (1896).
--
   Despite MacDonald's future influence with the novel At the Back of the
   North Wind (1871), Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, and H.
   G. Wells's novel The Wonderful Visit (1895), it was not until the 20th
   century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. Lord
   Dunsany established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the
   short story forms. H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, and Edgar Rice
   Burroughs began to write fantasy around this time. These authors, along
   with Abraham Merritt, established what was known as the lost world
   subgenre; this was the most popular form of fantasy in the early
   decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's
   fantasies, such as Peter Pan and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, were also
   published around this time.

   Juvenile fantasy was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended
   for adults, with the consequence that writers who wished to write
   fantasy for adults needed to fit their work into forms aimed at
   children.^[27] Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote fantasy in A Wonder-Book for
   Girls and Boys, intended for children,^[28] although his works for
   adults only verged on fantasy. For many years, this book and successes
   such as the novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) created a
   circular effect: all fantasy works, even the later series The Lord of
   the Rings, were therefore classified as children's
   literature.^[citation needed]

   Political and social trends can affect a society's reception of
   fantasy. In the early 20th century, the New Culture Movement's
   enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to
   condemn the fantastical shenmo genre of traditional Chinese literature.
   The spells and magical creatures in these novels were viewed as
   superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the
   modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be
   denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China
   experienced a revival in fantasy only after the Cultural Revolution had
   ended.^[29]

   Fantasy became a genre of pulp magazines published in the West. The
   first all-fantasy fiction magazine, Weird Tales, was published in 1923.
   Many similar magazines eventually followed, including The Magazine of
   Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF). When this magazine was founded in
   1949, the pulp format was at the height of its popularity; F&SF was
   instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the
   US and the UK. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of
   science fiction, and the two genres were first associated with each
   other around this time.
--
   By 1950, sword and sorcery fiction had begun to find a wider audience,
   with the success of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories and
   Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories.^[30] However, it was
   the advent of high fantasy—especially J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The
   Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, which reached new heights of
   popularity in the late 1960s—that allowed fantasy to enter the
   mainstream.^[31] Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's The
   Chronicles of Narnia and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea, helped to cement
   the genre's popularity.

   The popularity of the fantasy genre has continued to increase in the
   21st century, as evidenced by the best-selling status of several
   series: J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of
   Time, George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, Steven Erikson's

   hide dice rolls from the players.

   Fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) span several media. Dungeons &
   Dragons (D&D) was the first tabletop role-playing game, and it remains
   the most successful and influential. According to a 1999 survey in the
   United States, six percent of 12- to 35-year-olds have played

   D&D.^[32] Products branded Dungeons & Dragons accounted for over fifty
   percent of the RPG products sold in 2005.^[33]

   The science fantasy role-playing game series Final Fantasy has been an
   icon of the role-playing video game genre. (As of 2012^[update], it was
   still among the top ten best-selling video game franchises.) The first
   collectible card game, Magic: The Gathering, has a fantasy theme and is
   similarly dominant in the industry.^[34]

   [edit]

   In her book Rhetorics of Fantasy (2008),^[36] Farah Mendlesohn proposes
   a taxonomy of fantasy, as "determined by the means by which the
   fantastic enters the narrated world."^[37] (She notes some fantasies
   fit none of the patterns in this taxonomy.) The taxonomy categories are
   as follows:

   Portal fantasy
          In portal-quest fantasy or portal fantasy, a fantasy world is
          entered, within which the fantastic elements remain contained. A
          portal-quest fantasy typically tends to be a quest-type
          narrative, whose main challenge is navigating the fantastical
          world.^[38] Notable examples include L. Frank Baum's novel The
          Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), C. S. Lewis' novel The Lion, the
          Witch and the Wardrobe (1950),^[39] and Stephen R. Donaldson's
          series The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (late 1970s).^[40] In
          Japan, the genre of portal fantasy is known as isekai (Japanese:
          異世界; transl. "different world" or "otherworld"), which has
          developed its own set of conventions.

   Immersive fantasy
          In immersive fantasy, the fictional world is seen as complete;
          its fantastic elements remain unquestioned within the context of
          the story; and the reader perceives the world through the eyes
          and ears of characters native to the setting. This narrative
          mode "consciously negates the sense of wonder" often associated
          with science fiction, according to Mendlesohn. She adds that "a
          sufficiently effective immersive fantasy may be
          indistinguishable from science fiction" as the fantastic
          "acquires a scientific cohesion all of its own". This similarity
          has led to disputes about how to classify novels such as Mary
          Gentle's Ash (2000) and China Miéville's Perdido Street Station
          (2000).^[41]

   Intrusion fantasy
          In intrusion fantasy, the fantastic intrudes on reality (as
          portal fantasies do not), and the protagonists' engagement with
          that intrusion drives the story. Usually realist in style, these
          works assume the default world as their basis. Intrusion
--
          Classic intrusion fantasies include the novel Dracula (1897) by
          Bram Stoker and the book Mary Poppins (1934) by P. L.
          Travers.^[43] In French-speaking countries, this genre is called
          fantastique and is considered to be distinct from fantasy.

   Liminal fantasy
          In liminal fantasy, the fantastic enters a world that appears to
          be our own. The marvelous is perceived as normal by the
          protagonists, while it disconcerts and estranges the reader.
          This is a relatively rare mode. Such fantasies often adopt an
          ironic, blasé tone, as opposed to the straight-faced mimesis
          more common in fantasy.^[44] Examples include Joan Aiken's
          stories about the Armitage family, who are amazed that unicorns
          appear on their lawn on a Tuesday, rather than a Monday.^[43]

   Publishers, editors, authors, artists, and scholars who are interested
   in the fantasy genre meet annually at the World Fantasy Convention
   (WFC). The World Fantasy Awards are presented at this convention. The
   first WFC was held in 1975, and it has been held annually since that
   time (in a different city each year).

   In addition, many science fiction conventions, such as Florida's FX
   Show and MegaCon, cater to fantasy and horror fans. Anime conventions,
   such as Ohayocon and Anime Expo, often feature showings of fantasy,
   science fantasy, and dark fantasy series and films; examples include
   Majutsushi Orphen (fantasy), Sailor Moon (urban fantasy), Berserk (dark
   fantasy), and Spirited Away (fantasy). Many science-fiction/fantasy and

   subcultures within the main cultures:

     * the large internet subculture, which is devoted to reading and

   According to 2013 statistics from the fantasy publisher Tor Books, men
   outnumber women by 67% to 33% among writers of historical, epic or high
   fantasy. By contrast, among writers of urban fantasy or paranormal
   romance, 57% are women and 43% are men.^[45]

Analysis

   [edit]

   Fantasy is studied in a number of disciplines including English and
   other language studies, cultural studies, comparative literature,
   history, and medieval studies. Some works draw political, historical,
   and literary connections between medievalism and popular culture.^[46]
--
   uncertainty about their existence.^[47] However, this precise
   definition is not predominant in English critical literature; the
   French term fantastique is used to differentiate the French concept
   from the broader English term fantastic, a synonym of fantasy.
   Todorov's restrictive definition and differences in national critical
   traditions have led to controversies such as the one initiated by
   Stanislaw Lem.^[48]

   Rosemary Jackson builds on and also challenges Todorov's definition of
   the fantastic in her book Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion (1981).
   Jackson rejects the notion of the genre as a vessel for wish
   fulfillment that transcends human reality in worlds presented as
   superior to our own; instead she posits that the genre is inseparable

   Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction that involves supernatural or
   magical elements, often including completely imaginary realms and
   creatures.^[1]^[2]

   The genre's roots lie in fantasy literature and drama. From the
   twentieth century onward, it has expanded into various media, including
   film, television, graphic novels, manga, animation, and video games.

   Anglophone literary critics.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] An archaic spelling for
   the term is phantasy.^[7]

   Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction
   and horror by an absence of scientific or macabre themes, although
   these can occur in fantasy. In popular culture, the fantasy genre
   predominantly features settings that reflect the actual Earth, but with
   some sense of otherness.^[8]

   Many works of fantasy use magic or other supernatural elements as a
   main plot element, theme, or setting.^[9] Magic, magic practitioners
   (sorcerers, witches and so on) and magical creatures are common in many
   of these worlds.^[7]

   An identifying trait of fantasy is the author's use of narrative
   elements that do not have to rely on history or nature to be
   coherent.^[10] This differs from realistic fiction in that realistic
   fiction has to attend to the history and natural laws of reality, where
   fantasy does not. In writing fantasy the author uses worldbuilding to
   create characters, situations, and settings that may not be possible in
   reality.

   Many fantasy authors use real-world folklore and mythology as
   inspiration;^[11] and although another defining characteristic of the
   fantasy genre is the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as
   magic,^[12] this does not have to be the case.

   Fantasy has often been compared to science fiction and horror because
   they are the major categories of speculative fiction. Fantasy is
   distinguished from science fiction by the plausibility of the narrative
   elements. A science fiction narrative is unlikely, though seemingly
   possible through logical scientific or technological extrapolation,
   where fantasy narratives do not need to be scientifically
   possible.^[10] Authors have to rely on the readers' suspension of
   disbelief, an acceptance of the unbelievable or impossible for the sake
   of enjoyment, in order to write effective fantasies. Despite both
   genres' heavy reliance on the supernatural, fantasy and horror are
   distinguishable from one another. Horror primarily evokes fear through
   the protagonists' weaknesses or inability to deal with the
   antagonists.^[13]

   While elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were part of
   literature from its beginning, fantasy elements also occur throughout
   ancient religious texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh.^[14] The ancient
   Babylonian creation epic, the Enûma Eliš, in which the god Marduk slays
   the goddess Tiamat,^[15] reflects the theme of cosmic conflict between
   good and evil, which is characteristic of the modern fantasy
   genre.^[15] Genres of romantic and fantasy literature also existed in
   ancient Egypt.^[16] The Tales of the Court of King Khufu, which is
   preserved in the Westcar Papyrus and was probably written in the middle
   of the second half of the eighteenth century BC, preserves a mixture of
   stories with elements of historical fiction, fantasy, and
   satire.^[17]^[18] Egyptian funerary texts preserve mythological
   tales,^[16] the most significant of which are the myths of Osiris and
   his son Horus.^[16]
--
   which an Athenian man persuades the world's birds to build a city in
   the clouds and thereby challenges Zeus's authority.^[20] Ovid's
   Metamorphoses and Apuleius's The Golden Ass are both works that
   influenced the development of the fantasy genre^[20] by taking mythic
   elements and weaving them into personal accounts.^[20] Both works
   involve complex narratives in which humans beings are transformed into
   animals or inanimate objects.^[20] Platonic teachings and early
   Christian theology are major influences on the modern fantasy
   genre.^[20] Plato used allegories to convey many of his teachings,^[20]
   and early Christian writers interpreted both the Old and New Testaments
   as employing parables to convey spiritual truths.^[20] This ability to
   find meaning in a story that is not literally true became the
   foundation for developing the modern fantasy genre.^[20]

   Islamic, Hindu, and Chinese sources contain fantasy elements as well.
   The best-known fiction from the Islamic world is One Thousand and One
   Nights (The Arabian Nights), which is a compilation of ancient and
   medieval folk tales. Various characters from this epic have become
--
   particularly in the Indian epics. The Panchatantra (Fables of Bidpai),
   for example, used animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the
   central Indian principles of political science. Chinese traditions have
   been particularly influential in the vein of fantasy known as
   Chinoiserie, which includes such writers as Ernest Bramah and Barry
   Hughart.^[21]

   Beowulf is among the best known of the Old English tales in the
   English-speaking world, and it has deeply influenced the fantasy genre;
   several fantasy works have retold the story, for example, John
   Gardner's novel Grendel.^[22] Norse mythology, as found in the Elder
   Edda and Younger Edda collections, includes such figures as the god
   Odin and his fellow Aesir, in addition to dwarves, elves, dragons, and
   giants.^[23] These elements have been directly imported into various
   fantasy works. The distinct folklores of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland
   have sometimes been used indiscriminately for "Celtic" fantasy,
   sometimes with great success; other writers have specified the use of a
   single source.^[24] The Welsh tradition has been particularly
   influential, because of its connection to the legendary King Arthur and
   its collection into a single work, the epic Mabinogion.^[24]

   There are many works where the boundary between fantasy and other
   genres is unclear: did the writers believe in the possibility of the
   marvels in the play A Midsummer Night's Dream or the romance in Sir
   Gawain and the Green Knight? This question makes it difficult to
   distinguish when fantasy began, in its modern sense.^[25]

Modern fantasy

   and the Goblin

   Although pre-dated by John Ruskin's story The King of the Golden River
   (1841), the history of modern fantasy literature is usually said to
   begin with George MacDonald, the Scottish author of such novels as
   Phantastes (1858) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872); the former is
   widely considered to be the first fantasy novel ever written for
   adults. MacDonald was a major influence on both J. R. R. Tolkien and C.
   S. Lewis.^[26] The other major fantasy author of this era was William
   Morris, an English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of
   the century, including The Wood Beyond the World (1894) and The Well at
   the World's End (1896).
--
   Despite MacDonald's future influence with the novel At the Back of the
   North Wind (1871), Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, and H.
   G. Wells's novel The Wonderful Visit (1895), it was not until the 20th
   century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. Lord
   Dunsany established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the
   short story forms. H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, and Edgar Rice
   Burroughs began to write fantasy around this time. These authors, along
   with Abraham Merritt, established what was known as the lost world
   subgenre; this was the most popular form of fantasy in the early
   decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's
   fantasies, such as Peter Pan and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, were also
   published around this time.

   Juvenile fantasy was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended
   for adults, with the consequence that writers who wished to write
   fantasy for adults needed to fit their work into forms aimed at
   children.^[27] Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote fantasy in A Wonder-Book for
   Girls and Boys, intended for children,^[28] although his works for
   adults only verged on fantasy. For many years, this book and successes
   such as the novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) created a
   circular effect: all fantasy works, even the later series The Lord of
   the Rings, were therefore classified as children's
   literature.^[citation needed]

   Political and social trends can affect a society's reception of
   fantasy. In the early 20th century, the New Culture Movement's
   enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to
   condemn the fantastical shenmo genre of traditional Chinese literature.
   The spells and magical creatures in these novels were viewed as
   superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the
   modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be
   denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China
   experienced a revival in fantasy only after the Cultural Revolution had
   ended.^[29]

   Fantasy became a genre of pulp magazines published in the West. The
   first all-fantasy fiction magazine, Weird Tales, was published in 1923.
   Many similar magazines eventually followed, including The Magazine of
   Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF). When this magazine was founded in
   1949, the pulp format was at the height of its popularity; F&SF was
   instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the
   US and the UK. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of
   science fiction, and the two genres were first associated with each
   other around this time.
--
   By 1950, sword and sorcery fiction had begun to find a wider audience,
   with the success of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories and
   Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories.^[30] However, it was
   the advent of high fantasy—especially J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The
   Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, which reached new heights of
   popularity in the late 1960s—that allowed fantasy to enter the
   mainstream.^[31] Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's The
   Chronicles of Narnia and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea, helped to cement
   the genre's popularity.

   The popularity of the fantasy genre has continued to increase in the
   21st century, as evidenced by the best-selling status of several
   series: J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of
   Time, George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, Steven Erikson's

   Fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) span several media. Dungeons &
   Dragons (D&D) was the first tabletop role-playing game, and it remains
   the most successful and influential. According to a 1999 survey in the
   United States, six percent of 12- to 35-year-olds have played

   D&D.^[32] Products branded Dungeons & Dragons accounted for over fifty
   percent of the RPG products sold in 2005.^[33]

   The science fantasy role-playing game series Final Fantasy has been an
   icon of the role-playing video game genre. (As of 2012^[update], it was
   still among the top ten best-selling video game franchises.) The first
   collectible card game, Magic: The Gathering, has a fantasy theme and is
   similarly dominant in the industry.^[34]

   In her book Rhetorics of Fantasy (2008),^[36] Farah Mendlesohn proposes
   a taxonomy of fantasy, as "determined by the means by which the
   fantastic enters the narrated world."^[37] (She notes some fantasies
   fit none of the patterns in this taxonomy.) The taxonomy categories are
   as follows:

   Portal fantasy
          In portal-quest fantasy or portal fantasy, a fantasy world is
          entered, within which the fantastic elements remain contained. A
          portal-quest fantasy typically tends to be a quest-type
          narrative, whose main challenge is navigating the fantastical
          world.^[38] Notable examples include L. Frank Baum's novel The
          Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), C. S. Lewis' novel The Lion, the
          Witch and the Wardrobe (1950),^[39] and Stephen R. Donaldson's
          series The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (late 1970s).^[40] In
          Japan, the genre of portal fantasy is known as isekai (Japanese:
          異世界; transl. "different world" or "otherworld"), which has
          developed its own set of conventions.

   Immersive fantasy
          In immersive fantasy, the fictional world is seen as complete;
          its fantastic elements remain unquestioned within the context of
          the story; and the reader perceives the world through the eyes
          and ears of characters native to the setting. This narrative
          mode "consciously negates the sense of wonder" often associated
          with science fiction, according to Mendlesohn. She adds that "a
          sufficiently effective immersive fantasy may be
          indistinguishable from science fiction" as the fantastic
          "acquires a scientific cohesion all of its own". This similarity
          has led to disputes about how to classify novels such as Mary
          Gentle's Ash (2000) and China Miéville's Perdido Street Station
          (2000).^[41]

   Intrusion fantasy
          In intrusion fantasy, the fantastic intrudes on reality (as
          portal fantasies do not), and the protagonists' engagement with
          that intrusion drives the story. Usually realist in style, these
          works assume the default world as their basis. Intrusion
--
          Classic intrusion fantasies include the novel Dracula (1897) by
          Bram Stoker and the book Mary Poppins (1934) by P. L.
          Travers.^[43] In French-speaking countries, this genre is called
          fantastique and is considered to be distinct from fantasy.

   Liminal fantasy
          In liminal fantasy, the fantastic enters a world that appears to
          be our own. The marvelous is perceived as normal by the
          protagonists, while it disconcerts and estranges the reader.
          This is a relatively rare mode. Such fantasies often adopt an
          ironic, blasé tone, as opposed to the straight-faced mimesis
          more common in fantasy.^[44] Examples include Joan Aiken's
          stories about the Armitage family, who are amazed that unicorns
          appear on their lawn on a Tuesday, rather than a Monday.^[43]

   Publishers, editors, authors, artists, and scholars who are interested
   in the fantasy genre meet annually at the World Fantasy Convention
   (WFC). The World Fantasy Awards are presented at this convention. The
   first WFC was held in 1975, and it has been held annually since that
   time (in a different city each year).

   In addition, many science fiction conventions, such as Florida's FX
   Show and MegaCon, cater to fantasy and horror fans. Anime conventions,
   such as Ohayocon and Anime Expo, often feature showings of fantasy,
   science fantasy, and dark fantasy series and films; examples include
   Majutsushi Orphen (fantasy), Sailor Moon (urban fantasy), Berserk (dark
   fantasy), and Spirited Away (fantasy). Many science-fiction/fantasy and
   anime conventions also emphasize or cater to one or more of the
   subcultures within the main cultures:
     * the cosplay subculture, in which people make or wear costumes based
--
     * the large internet subculture, which is devoted to reading and
       writing prose fiction or doujinshi in or related to those genres

   According to 2013 statistics from the fantasy publisher Tor Books, men
   outnumber women by 67% to 33% among writers of historical, epic or high
   fantasy. By contrast, among writers of urban fantasy or paranormal
   romance, 57% are women and 43% are men.^[45]

Analysis

   [edit]

   Fantasy is studied in a number of disciplines including English and
   other language studies, cultural studies, comparative literature,
   history, and medieval studies. Some works draw political, historical,
   and literary connections between medievalism and popular culture.^[46]
--
   uncertainty about their existence.^[47] However, this precise
   definition is not predominant in English critical literature; the
   French term fantastique is used to differentiate the French concept
   from the broader English term fantastic, a synonym of fantasy.
   Todorov's restrictive definition and differences in national critical
   traditions have led to controversies such as the one initiated by
   Stanislaw Lem.^[48]

   Rosemary Jackson builds on and also challenges Todorov's definition of
   the fantastic in her book Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion (1981).
   Jackson rejects the notion of the genre as a vessel for wish
   fulfillment that transcends human reality in worlds presented as
   superior to our own; instead she posits that the genre is inseparable
