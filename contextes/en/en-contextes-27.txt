Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:
--

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
--
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:
--
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

--
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
--
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review
--
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
--
   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:
--
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

--
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
--

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
--

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
--
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life

       Thanks for the recommendations 🙂 I know I am a bit of a broken
       record, but I am hoping to dive into some fantasy this winter, when
       I have more time and have a reason to be bundled up in the house.

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.

       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like

   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.

                 Oh I definitely am. I just have to take breaks in between
                 books with epic fantasy novels for the most part lol.

       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life

       Thanks for the recommendations 🙂 I know I am a bit of a broken
       record, but I am hoping to dive into some fantasy this winter, when
       I have more time and have a reason to be bundled up in the house.

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.
