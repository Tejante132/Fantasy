   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   EW fantasy is mostly bombastic and "big", and not intimistic or "calm".
   For quiter mood i would rely on "rinascimento" from fluffy audio (i
   don't have it)

   ProjectSam Lumina is made for the Fantasy genre, and it is absolutely
   brilliant for it.

   Looks interesting! Though i would have to get the full version of
   kontakt. I see. I'll have to take a deeper look at what kind of sound I
   want, cuz from what I've heard of Fantasy orchestra, it sounds really
   nice.

   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   A lot of the Karoryfer stuff if you like your fantasy stuff a little
   quirkier. And Insanity Samples Shire Winds is a nice one.

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
--
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Kontakt 8 also comes with some older/ethnic instruments. Has anyone
   tried those? Best fantasy music VST? Best fantasy music VST?

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5

   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.
