   This Kingdom Will Not Kill Me by Ilona Andrews - Mar 31, 2026
   Official Blurb: When Maggie wakes up cold, filthy, and naked in a
   gutter, it doesn't take her long to recognize Kair Toren, a city she
   knows intimately from the pages of the famously unfinished dark fantasy
   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,
--
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to
   end Flann's quest before it begins.
   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.
