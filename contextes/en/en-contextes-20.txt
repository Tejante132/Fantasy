   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;
--
1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon
--
4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
--

7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his
--

8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.

   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

       For someone who claims to love fantasy (me), the fact that I’ve
       only read ONE of these books is a bit embarassing… better get to
       reading

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.

   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique

7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his

8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.

       For someone who claims to love fantasy (me), the fact that I’ve
       only read ONE of these books is a bit embarassing… better get to
       reading

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.
