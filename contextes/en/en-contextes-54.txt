   choice between behaving morally and behaving immorally to advance their
   goals. In Study 3, an MTurk sample judged the actions of a character
   who behaved immorally. For Study 1, a gender by condition interaction
   was found, with males electing more immoral actions in the fantasy
   condition. For Study 2, no such effect was found. Nonetheless, in Study
   3, participants judged immoral actions in the realistic condition as
   more immoral compared to the fantasy context. Across all studies,
   transportation predicted choosing fewer immoral actions and judging
   immoral actions more harshly.
