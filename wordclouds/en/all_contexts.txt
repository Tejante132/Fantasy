2025 Fantasy Football: Week 15 Start ‘Em, Sit ‘Em, Picks And Busts

   Let’s dive into some news and notes around the league, my top fantasy
   plays and favorite picks for Week 15.

   Notes:

   • If you made it to the fantasy football playoffs, congratulations! If
   you did not, hopefully your league still has something to play for. If
   you finished in last place, take the punishment without any issues.

   • The injury bug was back in Week 15, and it could not have come at a
   worse time for fantasy owners. Daniel Jones is currently QB10 but is
   now out for the season with an Achilles injury. Jayden Daniels was a
   surprise return to the lineup for the Commanders but was forced out in
   the second half in Minnesota. CeeDee Lamb, Tee Higgins and De’Von
--
   his terrific career with a knee injury. As always, check my player
   rankings for the best available players.

   • The biggest unknown this time of the year is whether fantasy stars
   will get benched to rest for the playoffs. The Bills-Patriots matchup
   this weekend could have implications that could lead to this very
   scenario. This is something to keep a track of the next couple of
   weeks. It is plausible that Drake Maye is not an option for fantasy
   owners in Week 17.

   • Remember to check the weather heading into Sunday for your kicker

   Week 2: Zay Flowers remains the overall WR1 after torching the Browns
   (miss)
   Week 3: Daniel Jones makes it three straight weeks finishing as a
   top-five fantasy quarterback (miss)
   Week 4: Josh Allen accounts for five total touchdowns against the
   Saints (miss)
   Week 5: A tight end leads all FLEX-worthy players in scoring (miss)

   Week 13: Jaxon Smith-Njigba is held under 100 receiving yards (winner
   winner!)
   Week 14: Lamar Jackson gets back on track and finishes as a top-three
   fantasy quarterback against the Steelers (miss)
   Week 15: Nico Collins posts more than 150 receiving yards against the

What Are Fantasy Sports?

   Right out of the gate, to avoid confusion, the term manager will
   describe a person participating in a fantasy sport while a player will
   describe the professional athletes whose performance you are following.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It’s the 21st century, so to define “fantasy sports”, let’s take to the
   internet, specifically everyone’s favorite research starting point –
   Wikipedia:

     A fantasy sport is a type of online game where participants assemble
     imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.
     These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those
     players’ players in actual games. This performance is converted into
     points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected
     by each fantasy team’s manager. These point systems can be simple
     enough to be manually calculated by a “league commissioner” who
     coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be
     compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of
     the professional sport. In fantasy sports, team managers draft,
     trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.

   Being a fantasy sports manager is similar being a day trader in the
   stock market. Envision individual players as stocks. Your goal is to
   buy, sell, and trade your players in order to have the highest
   accumulated value at the end of the season.

   Where does “value” come from in fantasy sports? One word: statistics.
   In every sport, there are a multitude of stats that can be used to
   define an individual player’s level of performance. If you look at at a
   baseball box score, hits, RBIs, batting average, earned run average
--
   yards, touchdowns, interceptions thrown, and extra points kicked; in
   basketball, there are points, assists, turnovers, and blocks; in soccer
   and hockey, there are goals, assists, shutouts, and plus/minus. Not
   just scoring plays, but ALL statistics could have value in fantasy
   sports.

   Value is also governed by the rules of the market, the market being
   your fantasy sports league. Before the season starts, your league will
   agree to a set of scoring rules for how each player’s statistics will
   be counted. Based on the scoring rules chosen by the league, managers
   will then select a certain number of players to be on their teams,
   typically done by a draft. Any players that are not taken in the draft
   are free agents. (Check out our introductions to each fantasy sport to
   see specific scoring, draft, and free agent formats.)

   With a full team of players, you are now a fantasy sports manager!

   You have made an initial investment by drafting players onto your team.
   Once the season begins, you must begin to manage and evaluate your

   are those in which every manager regularly participates in trying to
   improve their rosters.

   Fantasy sports offers a glimpse into what actual professional sports
   general managers value when they assemble and manage their teams. You
   becoming engaged to sports in a whole new level. Once you start
   playing. you will likely find yourself not just interested in the wins
--
   rival.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here at PFS, our goal is to emphasize that fantasy sports are meant to
   be friendly competitions, done for bragging rights more than anything
   else. We see an opportunity to increase the value of those bragging
   rights. What if, along with winning your league, you were able to say
   that you donated money to cause you care deeply about. That is exactly
   what PFS does: we bring people together to play fantasy sports and
   raise money for your favorite philanthropic organizations.

What Are Fantasy Sports?

   Right out of the gate, to avoid confusion, the term manager will
   describe a person participating in a fantasy sport while a player will
   describe the professional athletes whose performance you are following.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It’s the 21st century, so to define “fantasy sports”, let’s take to the
   internet, specifically everyone’s favorite research starting point –
   Wikipedia:

     A fantasy sport is a type of online game where participants assemble
     imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.
     These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those
     players’ players in actual games. This performance is converted into
     points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected
     by each fantasy team’s manager. These point systems can be simple
     enough to be manually calculated by a “league commissioner” who
     coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be
     compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of
     the professional sport. In fantasy sports, team managers draft,
     trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.

   Being a fantasy sports manager is similar being a day trader in the
   stock market. Envision individual players as stocks. Your goal is to
   buy, sell, and trade your players in order to have the highest
   accumulated value at the end of the season.

   Where does “value” come from in fantasy sports? One word: statistics.
   In every sport, there are a multitude of stats that can be used to
   define an individual player’s level of performance. If you look at at a
   baseball box score, hits, RBIs, batting average, earned run average

     * © 2006-2026 Fantasy Book Review

   Whether you’ve sat around waiting for your Hogwarts letter or looked
   for Narnia in the back of a closet, you've probably dreamt of stepping
   into your favorite fantasy books and leaving the real world behind. But
   the genre isn’t all witches, wardrobes, and whimsy! Beyond offering
   temporary escape from the pressures of daily life, the best fantasy
   books help us confront them.

   Stories of the otherworldly allow readers to make sense of this world,
   refracting change, wickedness, and heartache through a magical lens so
   we can see them all more clearly — and face them head-on. A good
   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!

   If you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of amazing fantasy books on

   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a

   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust
   Pacific Northwest, in which the surviving humans have diverged into
   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four
   elephants balanced on a turtle. The 41-book series is a world unto its
   own — and it all began with The Color of Magic. Pratchett conceived the
   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that
   saturated the market at the time. The result is playful-yet-thoughtful
   story about an incompetent wizard and a ignorant tourist, whose
   adventure reads like a hilarious, sparkling travelogue.

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four
   elephants balanced on a turtle. The 41-book series is a world unto its
   own — and it all began with The Color of Magic. Pratchett conceived the
   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that
   saturated the market at the time. The result is playful-yet-thoughtful
   story about an incompetent wizard and a ignorant tourist, whose
   adventure reads like a hilarious, sparkling travelogue.

   Bring your stories to life

   Whether you’ve sat around waiting for your Hogwarts letter or looked
   for Narnia in the back of a closet, you've probably dreamt of stepping
   into your favorite fantasy books and leaving the real world behind. But
   the genre isn’t all witches, wardrobes, and whimsy! Beyond offering
   temporary escape from the pressures of daily life, the best fantasy
   books help us confront them.

   Stories of the otherworldly allow readers to make sense of this world,
   refracting change, wickedness, and heartache through a magical lens so
   we can see them all more clearly — and face them head-on. A good
   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!

   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition)

   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in
   Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike since it was
   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a
   momentous early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.

   The King of Elfland's Daughter

   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as
   one of the greatest writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust

   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

18 Common Fantasy Subgenres

   Fantasy novels take on many forms, and the number of distinct fantasy
   subgenres seems to grow with each passing year. Here are 18
   particularly important subgenres within the world of fantasy:
    1. 1. Dystopian fantasy: Sometimes grouped in with science fiction,
       speculative fiction, and literary fiction, dystopian fantasies
       imagine worlds gone wrong. The settings are at once familiar to
       contemporary audiences and also alarmingly worse than the present
       world. Jack Vance’s Dying Earth series is a pulpy example of this
       subgenre of fantasy fiction.
    2. 2. High fantasy: Sometimes called “epic fantasy,” high fantasy is
       set in a magical environment that has its own rules and physical
       laws. This subgenre’s plots and themes have a grand scale and
       typically center on a single, well-developed hero or a band of
       heroes, such as Frodo Baggins and his cohorts in J.R.R. Tolkien’s
       The Lord of the Rings or Bilbo Baggins and the dwarves in The
       Hobbit. George R.R. Martin combines high fantasy with elements of
       medieval fantasy and romance in his Song of Ice and Fire series
       (and the Game of Thrones television series based upon those books).
    3. 3. Low fantasy: Set in the real world, low fantasy includes
       unexpected magical elements that surprise ordinary characters, like
       the plastic figurines come to life in Lynne Reid Banks’s The Indian
       in the Cupboard.
    4. 4. Magical realism: While similar to low fantasy, magical realism
       characters accept fantastical elements like levitation and
       telekinesis as a normal part of their otherwise realistic world, as
       in Gabriel García Márquez’s magical realism classic One Hundred
       Years of Solitude.
    5. 5. Sword and sorcery: A subset of high fantasy, this subgenre
       focuses on sword-wielding heroes—such as the titular barbarian in
       Robert E. Howard’s Conan pulp fiction stories—as well as magic or
       witchcraft. J.K. Rowling popularized the sword and sorcery subgenre
       for young adults with her Harry Potter series.
    6. 6. Urban fantasy: Urban fantasy is a genre of literature
       encompassing novels, novellas, and short stories in which
       fantastical characters and concepts are placed in a real world
       urban setting, often in the present day. Urban fantasy novels have
       devoted followings and they have spawned film and TV adaptations.
       Urban fantasy stories often draw from noir and gritty police
       procedurals. They also may incorporate fantastical elements and
       supernatural creatures. These could involve undead zombies,
       vampires, druids, demons, wizardry, witchcraft, and other such
       fantasy tropes. The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher is an example of
       urban fantasy.
    7. 7. Paranormal romance: This fantasy subgenre combines romantic
       themes with fantasy elements like vampires, werewolves, shifters,
       faeries, and zombie armies. Many contemporary fantasy series blur
       the line between urban fantasy stories, coming-of-age tales, and
       paranormal romances. Patricia Briggs and Jeaniene Frost are popular
       authors in this subgenre.
    8. 8. Dark fantasy: Combining elements of fantasy with the horror
       genre, dark fantasy’s aim is to unnerve and frighten readers. For
       example, consider the gargantuan, otherworldly monsters in H. P.
       Lovecraft’s universe. Gothic and Victorian dark fantasy tends to
       embrace a paranormal setting and supernatural elements, which can
       range from vampires to werewolves and beyond. Note that by no means
       is every paranormal fantasy a dark fantasy.
    9. 9. Grimdark fantasy: One step beyond dark fantasy, grimdark novels
       pry into the blackest depths of the human condition, often in the
       proverbial underbelly of an alternate world. The Court of Broken
       Knives by Anna Smith Spark is a popular book within this subgenre.

       “Once upon a time, in a land far, far away…”) where trolls,
       dragons, witches, and other supernatural characters are an accepted
       truth, as in the Brothers Grimm’s Grimms’ Fairy Tales.
   12. 12. Superhero fantasy: Unlike stories in which a hero acquires
       special abilities through scientific means, such as exposure to
       radiation, the protagonists’ powers in more fantastical superhero
       stories are supernatural. Many superhero stories are set in a low
       fantasy world—one that’s quite similar to our own world.
       Superheroes ranging from Wonder Woman to Thor bring fantasy
       elements to worlds that otherwise obey the known laws of science.
       Many superhero fantasy authors have worked in the comic book
       medium, from Stan Lee to Bob Kane. As such, superhero fiction in
       the fantasy genre is also known as comic fantasy or comic book
       fantasy.
   13. 13. Fantasy of manners: This subgenre, exemplified by fantasy books
       like Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake, combines supernatural
       world-building with the type of society-centric concerns one might
       encounter in a work by Edith Wharton or Noel Coward. Human drama
       and pettiness may outweigh magical powers in this subgenre of
       fantasy literature.
   14. 14. Crossworlds fantasy: Sometimes called portal fantasy, this
       subgenre involves characters transporting from a normal world to a
       magical one. This requires authors to engage in both magical
       world-building and grounded realistic world-building. Crossworlds
       fantasy stories often appeal to children, as seen in the Chronicles
       of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis and Alice in Wonderland by Lewis
       Carroll. These works also fit a category known as juvenile fantasy.
   15. 15. Steampunk fantasy: This highly specific subgenre combines the
       Victorian science and technology of the Industrial Revolution with
       contemporary takes on robots and machines. As such, steampunk
       fantasy is at once alternate history, science fantasy, and a modern
       fantasy—although the specifics vary with specific novels. Soulless
       by Gail Carriger is a particularly well-regarded steampunk fantasy
       novel.
   16. 16. Arthurian fantasy: These historical fantasy stories exist in a
       magical world of King Arthur, although Arthur himself is not always
       the main character. Due to their magical setting, Arthurian fantasy
       novels and short stories tend to feature mythic creatures like
       dragons, and many of their heroes are knights—which also makes them
       part of the heroic fantasy subgenre.
   17. 17. Sci-fi fantasy: These stories can be set in any variety of time
       periods—which means they can be a contemporary fantasy, a modern
       fantasy, a futuristic fantasy, or even historical fantasy—but they
       establish a new world where scientific advancements have changed
       the rules of engagement, while still incorporating magical
       elements. The Star Wars series and the various works of Isaac
       Asimov have helped set the bar for sci-fi fantasy.
   18. 18. Wuxia fantasy: This subgenre is rooted in classic Chinese
       literature. It involves elements of fantasy interspersed with
       martial arts. Jade City by Fonda Lee is an example of wuxia
       fantasy.

       fantasy, a futuristic fantasy, or even historical fantasy—but they
       establish a new world where scientific advancements have changed
       the rules of engagement, while still incorporating magical
       elements. The Star Wars series and the various works of Isaac
       Asimov have helped set the bar for sci-fi fantasy.
   18. 18. Wuxia fantasy: This subgenre is rooted in classic Chinese
       literature. It involves elements of fantasy interspersed with
       martial arts. Jade City by Fonda Lee is an example of wuxia
       fantasy.

Fantasy Lyrics

   The lead single for Mariah’s Daydream album, this R&B song topped the
   US charts for eight consecutive weeks, and gained strong success
--
   Darlin', if you only knew
   All the things that flow through my mind
   [Chorus]
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
   (And I want you so badly)
   [Post-Chorus]
   Sha-do-do-do-do
--
   When you take me over
   Time and time and time again
   [Chorus]
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
   Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
   [Bridge]
   I'm in heaven
   With my boyfriend, my laughin' boyfriend
   There's no beginning and there is no end
   Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
   [Chorus]
   Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   When I close my eyes, you come and take me
   On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
   But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
   Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

     I had the melody idea for ‘Fantasy’ and I was listening to the radio
     and heard ‘Genius of Love,’ and I hadn’t heard it in a long time. It
     reminded me of growing up and listening to the radio and that
     feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea
     I had for ‘Fantasy.’ I initially told [co-writer] Dave Hall about
     the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were
     really into it.

   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;
--
1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon
--
4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
--

7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his

8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.

Top Ten Tuesday : Fantasy Books You’d Be a Fool Not to Read

   Top Ten Tuesday was created by The Broke and the Bookish in June of
   2010 and was moved to That Artsy Reader Girl in January of 2018. It was
--


   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
--

7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his
--

8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.

   What books are on your list of fantasy books you’d be a fool not to
   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

25 of the Best Fantasy Books You Should Read Next

   [25bestfantasybooks.jpg]

   I know what it’s like: sometimes you finish a book and you just don’t
   know what to read next. That’s why I’ve put this list together of 25 of
   the best fantasy books (in no particular order) that should be at the
   top of your to-read list!

   And if you’re in the mood for science fiction instead, I’ve got a list
--

Assassin’s Apprentice

   Any list of the best fantasy books has to start with Assassin’s
   Apprentice! The beginning of the Farseer trilogy, and also the
   beginning of a nine book series that tells the life of Fitz, bastard
   son of a disgraced prince, and his remarkable, hidden role in history.

   Hobb’s Fitz books are very much a coming of age story, so if you’re a
   fan of tight action and lean prose, pass on this one. But if you like a
   fantasy book that enjoys its time with the world and it’s characters,
   take a look at Assassin’s Apprentice.

   Fitz is a great viewpoint character, flawed but full of good
--

A Sorcerer Slain

   If you liked the sound of a murder mystery in a fantasy novel, but
   didn’t really want a fantasy-Sherlock Holmes, then A Sorcerer Slain is
   for you. It’s funny, action-packed, and clever. And perhaps the
   greatest praise I can heap upon this book is that the lead character
   and investigator, Lowmar Dashiel, thinks like a real person.
--
   applaud every time.

   This smart writing extends to the genre blending that takes place in
   this novel. When I first heard that Sivers was writing fantasy crime,
   my first thought was that those genres were unusual bedfellows. But A
   Sorcerer Slain is proof they make an excellent match; it calls no
   attention to itself, borrowing tropes from both fantasy and crime as it
   wills. At no point do these genres clash, and most of the time they’re
   perfectly balanced.

   In fact, the only thing that lets down this novel is when those genres
   become unbalanced, and it embraces the fantasy genre too strongly. For
   instance, there’s a great battle which on paper sounds great for a
   fantasy novel. But this book is smaller, more intimate, and the battle
   felt out of place to me. Once things had got back to Dashiel’s smaller
   world, things felt more natural.

   So if epic fantasy is the only kind of fantasy you’ll entertain, give
   this one a pass. But if you’re in the mood for something a little
   different, this crime fantasy might just scratch that itch.

Children of Blood and Bone

   If you’re tired of medieval-European fantasy, this is an excellent
   choice for your next read. Adeyemi has written a story of persecution,
   magic, and raw emotion that will catch you by surprise at times. This
   might be a YA novel, but it doesn’t pull any punches; alongside the
--
   hinges on these conflicting desires that I honestly wasn’t sure which
   way the story was going to go, which is always a good thing!

   Filled with character-driven, action-filled fantasy that differs from
   the usual medieval-European fare, and unexpectedly moving at
   times, Children of Blood and Bone really is one of the best fantasy
   books out there.

   Or, give it a listen: I got a copy of the audiobook for Children of
--
The Lies of Locke Lamora

   I always think of The Lies of Locke Lamora as Ocean’s 11 meets epic
   fantasy. It’s not a perfect analogy; for instance, Scott Lynch’s novel
   doesn’t feature Don Cheadle gamely trying to squeeze as much Cockney
   rhyming slang into his dialogue as he can. But if you love a good heist
   but you like fantasy worlds too, this is the book for you.

   Locke Lamora is a member of the Gentlemen Bastards, a gang of thieves
   working under the leadership of Father Chains. They all find themselves
--

Redwall

   Brian Jacques’ Redwall is the first in an epic fantasy series for
   children starring English woodland animals. It’s quaint and it’s sweet
   and it’s fun. It’s a fantastic introduction to fantasy for children or,
   if you’re an adult, it’s a great read between thick fantasy tomes.

   The eponymous Redwall is an abbey, populated by mice, which faces the
   threat of Cluny the Scourge, the appropriately named rat leader of an
--
   There’s legendary warriors, an ancient sword, and riddles that will
   puzzle and please young minds (although quite how the logic works will
   puzzle older ones). Redwall should definitely be on your reading list,
   and is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy books around!

The Hobbit

   The Lord of the Rings gets all the hype and the glory, but I think The
   Hobbit is not just under-appreciated, but even (dare I say it) more
   deserving of a place on a list of the best fantasy books than it’s
   younger, bigger brother.

   Tolkien’s first major work benefits from being a sleeker, more focused
--
   decapitation of a goblin.

   The origin of golf sums up The Hobbit rather nicely, in fact. This is a
   fantasy adventure that isn’t meant to be taken too seriously. That
   doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high, or that there aren’t
   thrilling scenes and perilous moments. But this is fantasy without the
   grit and grime, so it’s perfect for when you need a spot of levity and
   adventure in your reading list.

Grendel

   This is a bit of a different one. If you like your fantasy full of
   adventure, give this one a miss. But if you’re in the mood for
   something contemplative, take a look at John C Gardner’s exploration of
   the monster Grendel.
--
   this book feels less like an exploration of a character, and more that
   the character is simply a vehicle for an exploration of philosophy. In
   fact, there were times when reading Grendel that I wondered if Gardner
   was simply using the tropes of fantasy to write a philosophical
   treatise. Which feels unfair, because even in those moments I found
   myself enjoying the story.

   But that, in a sense, is why I always recommend Grendel, because it’s
   by no definition a standard fantasy novel. I won’t lie to you: once
   you’ve read it, you might not want to read something like it again. But
   fantasy is such a huge, wide genre that can encompass so many different
   stories. Grendel is a contemplative fantasy, and it’s a masterclass in
   taking what was a fairly nondescript monster (from Beowulf, if you
   weren’t sure), and turning it into something you can not only empathise
   with, but end up rooting for.
--
   commits decent acts, although almost by accident.

   I was also somewhat surprised to discover that this wasn’t a medieval
   fantasy, but instead a fantasy set in a far-off, post-apocalyptic
   world. Lawrence does a very good job of weaving in hints of this world
   without being heavy-handed, which I appreciated; all too often, such a
   setting is handled with the subtlety of a brick to the face.
--
   Considering that much of Spiderlight feels like it’s based on D&D
   tropes, I was actually beginning to enjoy reading about the characters.
   This is a stand-alone novel, so there isn’t much room for the stakes to
   get to the usual dramatic heights of epic fantasy, but they felt high
   enough for an enjoyable read.

   And, while Spiderlight might not revolutionise the fantasy genre, I was
   too busy empathising with a creepy, giant spider to really notice.

Warbreaker
--
   What if you just want a taster to see if you like the author’s work
   before you dive in? Warbreaker is the taster you’ve been looking for.

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and
   such. I did, however, appreciate that the magic system creates what are
   essentially walking gods. One of them was even my favourite character;
   Lightsong is somewhat jaded and disconnected from his life of luxury,
--
   reinterpret its story and themes? Whatever it is, Frank Beddor
   certainly has a fresh take on things.

   Take Alice in Wonderland and put it in the epic fantasy blender.
   There’s a lost princess whose throne has been usurped, a kingdom under
   a tyrant’s rule, and an assassin; yes, the Mad Hatter has become the
   Hatter Madigan, and he’s a badass assassin now.

   There are certainly times where the story veers into epic fantasy
   cliches, but it’s almost a pleasure to see how Beddor twists the
   classic tale to fit the cliches. Unfortunately, it looks like this book
   is out of print, so you might have to hunt it down. I recommend you do.
   I had a lot of fun reading it and, if you enjoy epic fantasy and
   alternative takes on Alice, you will too.

The Broken Sword
--
   Published the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring (and therefore
   uninfluenced by Tolkien), The Broken Sword is a novel that has all the
   matter-of-fact grimness of Norse legends (and some of the characters
   and settings, too), whilst telling an epic fantasy tale in much less
   space than Tolkien ever managed it.

   The book tells the story of the son of Orm the Strong, Scafloc.
--
   of inevitable doom that comes from a culture whose philosophy ends with
   Ragnarok in which everyone dies (well, almost everyone).

   This is fantasy that isn’t inspired by Christian values or even
   traditional good vs evil narratives. If you’re the sort of person who
   enjoys the Norse mythology, this is a fantasy novel for you. And if
   you’re looking for something a little less spiritually uplifting than
   traditional fantasy, you should give this a go too.

Mort

--
   it’s sweet, and it’s full of clever observations of life that make you
   think a little too much, and laugh plenty.

   But the humour isn’t what makes this a great fantasy novel. It’s
   Pratchett’s inventiveness that does that. He likes to indulge in all
   the tropes of fantasy, and play and lampoon them in clever ways. For
   instance, magical rites are performed with plenty of pomp and ceremony,
   but Pratchett reveals that this is more to do with pride and
   professional prestige; most magic can be performed with very little
   indeed. I also liked the way Pratchett incorporated the idea of
   morphogenetics, ludicrous in real life but fascinating “science” for a
   fantasy novel. And, of course, the way Ankh-Morpork reflects every
   major city is always insightful and hilarious.

   But the truth is that I like this book so much because of Death. Of
--

A Game of Thrones

   If you’re someone who loves a grounded fantasy full of detail and lore
   that also feels like it could actually happen, the first book of the
   Song of Ice and Fire series is for you. You can understand why it takes
   George R R Martin so long to write one of these, because they’re packed
--
   But be warned: there are no happy endings in Westeros.

   One of the reasons A Game of Thrones has attracted so much attention is
   that it is a fantasy novel like no other. It is brutal, it is coarse,
   it is harsh and it has no remorse. Martin doesn’t tip-toe around the
   truth of the story. Characters have sex, get hurt, get maimed, and die.
   Love that character? They’re going to die. Hate that character? Well,
--
   it.

   But don’t let that put you off. This is certainly no straightforward
   adventure fantasy, and it’s a book that requires all of your attention
   to keep it straight in your mind. But I have never read a fantasy novel
   that felt so real and even as it threatens to confuse you with its
   complexity at every step, it develops in you a kind of Stockholm
   Syndrome. Even as the novel abuses your mind, you can’t help but start
--
   cynical with some dark humour mixed in. In fact, it’s hard to shake the
   feeling that this is the sort of book I should be writing…

   Rivers of London is an urban fantasy, telling the story of regular
   policeman Peter Grant who stumbles across the existence of a secret
   branch of the police that deals with the paranormal. A fairly standard
   urban fantasy plot so far. But the way Aaronovitch builds his world has
   a surprisingly Neil Gaiman-esque vibe to it; I saw surprising because
   of the humour that’s laced throughout the book. Seriously, if you ever
   needed a book called A Practical Guide to Sarcasm, this book would be a
--

   Still, the hype around this series is deserved. Even if you’re not a
   big fan of sarcasm, give it a read: I think you’ll agree it belongs on
   a list of the best fantasy books.

Truckers

--
   Ann Leckie is a phenomenal writer, and I try to hold off from buying
   her books because I devour them in a matter of days, leaving me left to
   wait until the next one is released. The Raven Tower is her first
   fantasy book and, while I have to admit it wasn’t as great as her
   Imperial Radch trilogy, it’s pretty great.

   One disclaimer, though: it’s written in the second person. Like
--

   One other warning: this is not a book if you want sword and sorcery and
   adventure. In fact, the book ends where many other authors would launch
   into the big meaty action scenes! This is a different kind of fantasy
   novel. It’s not without action. But it’s more cerebral. If you’re
   looking for a change of pace that’s brilliantly written, you can’t go
   wrong with The Raven Tower.
--
   disappoint.

   Lewis was a contemporary of Tolkien, and it shows: you won’t get gritty
   or grounded fantasy, but something far more allegorical. In fact, the
   Aslan/Jesus parallels are almost a little too on the nose at times, but
   you’ll let Lewis off the hook because Aslan is great. And if he’s a
   little too perfect, the White Witch is a little too frightening really.
--

Talion: Revenant

   Michael A Stackpole writes a fantastic line in late-80s fantasy
   fiction. It might seem quaint by comparison with the grittier fare that
   is modern fantasy, but it’s hard not to enjoy the way Stackpole romps
   through the story of Nolan, a young man training to be a Justice.

   Let’s be clear that this novel is not a weighty tome; it’s a fun,
--
   there’s plenty of action. Goblins and sorcerers, wood elves and the
   undead. This is a galloping blockbuster of a novel, and if it doesn’t
   require a lot of thought, it’s a lot of fun to read. Is that enough to
   warrant a place on a list of the best fantasy books? I think so. Not
   every fantasy book has to be a sprawling epic, a mighty trilogy, or an
   overwrought drama. Sometimes it’s just a fun piece of escapism, and
   Talion: Revenant is certainly that.

--
The Fey Man

   Don’t think I’m being egotistical and trying to include my own novel in
   a list of the best fantasy books! But it would be madness not to at
   least mention The Fey Man. Obviously I’m biased, but I think you’ll
   like it!

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and

   essentially walking gods. One of them was even my favourite character;
   Lightsong is somewhat jaded and disconnected from his life of luxury,
--
   reinterpret its story and themes? Whatever it is, Frank Beddor
   certainly has a fresh take on things.

   Take Alice in Wonderland and put it in the epic fantasy blender.
   There’s a lost princess whose throne has been usurped, a kingdom under
   a tyrant’s rule, and an assassin; yes, the Mad Hatter has become the
   Hatter Madigan, and he’s a badass assassin now.

   There are certainly times where the story veers into epic fantasy
   cliches, but it’s almost a pleasure to see how Beddor twists the
   classic tale to fit the cliches. Unfortunately, it looks like this book
   is out of print, so you might have to hunt it down. I recommend you do.
   I had a lot of fun reading it and, if you enjoy epic fantasy and
   alternative takes on Alice, you will too.

The Broken Sword
--
   Published the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring (and therefore
   uninfluenced by Tolkien), The Broken Sword is a novel that has all the
   matter-of-fact grimness of Norse legends (and some of the characters
   and settings, too), whilst telling an epic fantasy tale in much less
   space than Tolkien ever managed it.

   The book tells the story of the son of Orm the Strong, Scafloc.
--
   of inevitable doom that comes from a culture whose philosophy ends with
   Ragnarok in which everyone dies (well, almost everyone).

   This is fantasy that isn’t inspired by Christian values or even
   traditional good vs evil narratives. If you’re the sort of person who
   enjoys the Norse mythology, this is a fantasy novel for you. And if
   you’re looking for something a little less spiritually uplifting than
   traditional fantasy, you should give this a go too.

Mort

--
   it’s sweet, and it’s full of clever observations of life that make you
   think a little too much, and laugh plenty.

   But the humour isn’t what makes this a great fantasy novel. It’s
   Pratchett’s inventiveness that does that. He likes to indulge in all
   the tropes of fantasy, and play and lampoon them in clever ways. For
   instance, magical rites are performed with plenty of pomp and ceremony,
   but Pratchett reveals that this is more to do with pride and
   professional prestige; most magic can be performed with very little
   indeed. I also liked the way Pratchett incorporated the idea of
   morphogenetics, ludicrous in real life but fascinating “science” for a
   fantasy novel. And, of course, the way Ankh-Morpork reflects every
   major city is always insightful and hilarious.

   But the truth is that I like this book so much because of Death. Of

A Game of Thrones

   If you’re someone who loves a grounded fantasy full of detail and lore
   that also feels like it could actually happen, the first book of the
   Song of Ice and Fire series is for you. You can understand why it takes
   George R R Martin so long to write one of these, because they’re packed
--
   But be warned: there are no happy endings in Westeros.

   One of the reasons A Game of Thrones has attracted so much attention is
   that it is a fantasy novel like no other. It is brutal, it is coarse,
   it is harsh and it has no remorse. Martin doesn’t tip-toe around the
   truth of the story. Characters have sex, get hurt, get maimed, and die.
   Love that character? They’re going to die. Hate that character? Well,
--
   it.

   But don’t let that put you off. This is certainly no straightforward
   adventure fantasy, and it’s a book that requires all of your attention
   to keep it straight in your mind. But I have never read a fantasy novel
   that felt so real and even as it threatens to confuse you with its
   complexity at every step, it develops in you a kind of Stockholm
   Syndrome. Even as the novel abuses your mind, you can’t help but start
--
   cynical with some dark humour mixed in. In fact, it’s hard to shake the
   feeling that this is the sort of book I should be writing…

   Rivers of London is an urban fantasy, telling the story of regular
   policeman Peter Grant who stumbles across the existence of a secret
   branch of the police that deals with the paranormal. A fairly standard
   urban fantasy plot so far. But the way Aaronovitch builds his world has
   a surprisingly Neil Gaiman-esque vibe to it; I saw surprising because
   of the humour that’s laced throughout the book. Seriously, if you ever
   needed a book called A Practical Guide to Sarcasm, this book would be a
--

   Still, the hype around this series is deserved. Even if you’re not a
   big fan of sarcasm, give it a read: I think you’ll agree it belongs on
   a list of the best fantasy books.

Truckers

--
   Ann Leckie is a phenomenal writer, and I try to hold off from buying
   her books because I devour them in a matter of days, leaving me left to
   wait until the next one is released. The Raven Tower is her first
   fantasy book and, while I have to admit it wasn’t as great as her
   Imperial Radch trilogy, it’s pretty great.

   One disclaimer, though: it’s written in the second person. Like
--

   One other warning: this is not a book if you want sword and sorcery and
   adventure. In fact, the book ends where many other authors would launch
   into the big meaty action scenes! This is a different kind of fantasy
   novel. It’s not without action. But it’s more cerebral. If you’re
   looking for a change of pace that’s brilliantly written, you can’t go
   wrong with The Raven Tower.
--
   disappoint.

   Lewis was a contemporary of Tolkien, and it shows: you won’t get gritty
   or grounded fantasy, but something far more allegorical. In fact, the
   Aslan/Jesus parallels are almost a little too on the nose at times, but
   you’ll let Lewis off the hook because Aslan is great. And if he’s a
   little too perfect, the White Witch is a little too frightening really.
--

Talion: Revenant

   Michael A Stackpole writes a fantastic line in late-80s fantasy
   fiction. It might seem quaint by comparison with the grittier fare that
   is modern fantasy, but it’s hard not to enjoy the way Stackpole romps
   through the story of Nolan, a young man training to be a Justice.

   Let’s be clear that this novel is not a weighty tome; it’s a fun,
--
   there’s plenty of action. Goblins and sorcerers, wood elves and the
   undead. This is a galloping blockbuster of a novel, and if it doesn’t
   require a lot of thought, it’s a lot of fun to read. Is that enough to
   warrant a place on a list of the best fantasy books? I think so. Not
   every fantasy book has to be a sprawling epic, a mighty trilogy, or an
   overwrought drama. Sometimes it’s just a fun piece of escapism, and
   Talion: Revenant is certainly that.

The Fey Man

   Don’t think I’m being egotistical and trying to include my own novel in
   a list of the best fantasy books! But it would be madness not to at
   least mention The Fey Man. Obviously I’m biased, but I think you’ll

25 of the Best Fantasy Books You Should Read Next

   [25bestfantasybooks.jpg]

   I know what it’s like: sometimes you finish a book and you just don’t
   know what to read next. That’s why I’ve put this list together of 25 of
   the best fantasy books (in no particular order) that should be at the
   top of your to-read list!

   And if you’re in the mood for science fiction instead, I’ve got a list
--

Assassin’s Apprentice

   Any list of the best fantasy books has to start with Assassin’s
   Apprentice! The beginning of the Farseer trilogy, and also the
   beginning of a nine book series that tells the life of Fitz, bastard
   son of a disgraced prince, and his remarkable, hidden role in history.

   Hobb’s Fitz books are very much a coming of age story, so if you’re a
   fan of tight action and lean prose, pass on this one. But if you like a
   fantasy book that enjoys its time with the world and it’s characters,
   take a look at Assassin’s Apprentice.

   Fitz is a great viewpoint character, flawed but full of good
--

A Sorcerer Slain

   If you liked the sound of a murder mystery in a fantasy novel, but
   didn’t really want a fantasy-Sherlock Holmes, then A Sorcerer Slain is
   for you. It’s funny, action-packed, and clever. And perhaps the
   greatest praise I can heap upon this book is that the lead character
   and investigator, Lowmar Dashiel, thinks like a real person.
--
   applaud every time.

   This smart writing extends to the genre blending that takes place in
   this novel. When I first heard that Sivers was writing fantasy crime,
   my first thought was that those genres were unusual bedfellows. But A
   Sorcerer Slain is proof they make an excellent match; it calls no
   attention to itself, borrowing tropes from both fantasy and crime as it
   wills. At no point do these genres clash, and most of the time they’re
   perfectly balanced.

   In fact, the only thing that lets down this novel is when those genres
   become unbalanced, and it embraces the fantasy genre too strongly. For
   instance, there’s a great battle which on paper sounds great for a
   fantasy novel. But this book is smaller, more intimate, and the battle
   felt out of place to me. Once things had got back to Dashiel’s smaller
   world, things felt more natural.

   So if epic fantasy is the only kind of fantasy you’ll entertain, give
   this one a pass. But if you’re in the mood for something a little
   different, this crime fantasy might just scratch that itch.

Children of Blood and Bone

   If you’re tired of medieval-European fantasy, this is an excellent
   choice for your next read. Adeyemi has written a story of persecution,
   magic, and raw emotion that will catch you by surprise at times. This
   might be a YA novel, but it doesn’t pull any punches; alongside the
--
   hinges on these conflicting desires that I honestly wasn’t sure which
   way the story was going to go, which is always a good thing!

   Filled with character-driven, action-filled fantasy that differs from
   the usual medieval-European fare, and unexpectedly moving at
   times, Children of Blood and Bone really is one of the best fantasy
   books out there.

   Or, give it a listen: I got a copy of the audiobook for Children of
--
The Lies of Locke Lamora

   I always think of The Lies of Locke Lamora as Ocean’s 11 meets epic
   fantasy. It’s not a perfect analogy; for instance, Scott Lynch’s novel
   doesn’t feature Don Cheadle gamely trying to squeeze as much Cockney
   rhyming slang into his dialogue as he can. But if you love a good heist
   but you like fantasy worlds too, this is the book for you.

   Locke Lamora is a member of the Gentlemen Bastards, a gang of thieves
   working under the leadership of Father Chains. They all find themselves
--

Redwall

   Brian Jacques’ Redwall is the first in an epic fantasy series for
   children starring English woodland animals. It’s quaint and it’s sweet
   and it’s fun. It’s a fantastic introduction to fantasy for children or,
   if you’re an adult, it’s a great read between thick fantasy tomes.

   The eponymous Redwall is an abbey, populated by mice, which faces the
   threat of Cluny the Scourge, the appropriately named rat leader of an
--
   There’s legendary warriors, an ancient sword, and riddles that will
   puzzle and please young minds (although quite how the logic works will
   puzzle older ones). Redwall should definitely be on your reading list,
   and is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy books around!

The Hobbit

   The Lord of the Rings gets all the hype and the glory, but I think The
   Hobbit is not just under-appreciated, but even (dare I say it) more
   deserving of a place on a list of the best fantasy books than it’s
   younger, bigger brother.

   Tolkien’s first major work benefits from being a sleeker, more focused
--
   decapitation of a goblin.

   The origin of golf sums up The Hobbit rather nicely, in fact. This is a
   fantasy adventure that isn’t meant to be taken too seriously. That
   doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high, or that there aren’t
   thrilling scenes and perilous moments. But this is fantasy without the
   grit and grime, so it’s perfect for when you need a spot of levity and
   adventure in your reading list.

Grendel

   This is a bit of a different one. If you like your fantasy full of
   adventure, give this one a miss. But if you’re in the mood for
   something contemplative, take a look at John C Gardner’s exploration of
   the monster Grendel.
--
   this book feels less like an exploration of a character, and more that
   the character is simply a vehicle for an exploration of philosophy. In
   fact, there were times when reading Grendel that I wondered if Gardner
   was simply using the tropes of fantasy to write a philosophical
   treatise. Which feels unfair, because even in those moments I found
   myself enjoying the story.

   But that, in a sense, is why I always recommend Grendel, because it’s
   by no definition a standard fantasy novel. I won’t lie to you: once
   you’ve read it, you might not want to read something like it again. But
   fantasy is such a huge, wide genre that can encompass so many different
   stories. Grendel is a contemplative fantasy, and it’s a masterclass in
   taking what was a fairly nondescript monster (from Beowulf, if you
   weren’t sure), and turning it into something you can not only empathise
   with, but end up rooting for.
--
   commits decent acts, although almost by accident.

   I was also somewhat surprised to discover that this wasn’t a medieval
   fantasy, but instead a fantasy set in a far-off, post-apocalyptic
   world. Lawrence does a very good job of weaving in hints of this world
   without being heavy-handed, which I appreciated; all too often, such a
   setting is handled with the subtlety of a brick to the face.
--
   Considering that much of Spiderlight feels like it’s based on D&D
   tropes, I was actually beginning to enjoy reading about the characters.
   This is a stand-alone novel, so there isn’t much room for the stakes to
   get to the usual dramatic heights of epic fantasy, but they felt high
   enough for an enjoyable read.

   And, while Spiderlight might not revolutionise the fantasy genre, I was
   too busy empathising with a creepy, giant spider to really notice.

Warbreaker
--
   What if you just want a taster to see if you like the author’s work
   before you dive in? Warbreaker is the taster you’ve been looking for.

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and
   such. I did, however, appreciate that the magic system creates what are
   essentially walking gods. One of them was even my favourite character;
   Lightsong is somewhat jaded and disconnected from his life of luxury,
--
   reinterpret its story and themes? Whatever it is, Frank Beddor
   certainly has a fresh take on things.

   Take Alice in Wonderland and put it in the epic fantasy blender.
   There’s a lost princess whose throne has been usurped, a kingdom under
   a tyrant’s rule, and an assassin; yes, the Mad Hatter has become the
   Hatter Madigan, and he’s a badass assassin now.

   There are certainly times where the story veers into epic fantasy
   cliches, but it’s almost a pleasure to see how Beddor twists the
   classic tale to fit the cliches. Unfortunately, it looks like this book
   is out of print, so you might have to hunt it down. I recommend you do.
   I had a lot of fun reading it and, if you enjoy epic fantasy and
   alternative takes on Alice, you will too.

   uninfluenced by Tolkien), The Broken Sword is a novel that has all the
   matter-of-fact grimness of Norse legends (and some of the characters

Gardens of the Moon by Steven Eriskon – 657 pages

   Tommye from The Fantasy Review: “Gardens of the Moon is one of the
   best fantasy books I have ever read. The world is rich and its history
   angry and proud. Steven Erikson’s first book in Malazan Book of the
   Fallen is a masterpiece.”
     __________________________________________________________________
--

The Dragonbone Chair – 672 pages

   FantasyBookReview: “This is epic fantasy, nearly 800 pages of it and it
   lasts the pace well. The Dragonbone Chair brings together all the
   elements that are found in many a fantasy book and re-produces them in
   a beautiful and endearing way.”

Royal Assassin – 675 pages (Assassin’s Quest is even bigger at 869 pages)
--

Theft of Swords – 691 pages

   Nils Shukla for The Fantasy Hive: “Theft of Swords really embodies the
   high fantasy genre, it includes organically likable characters and a
   world so wonderfully layered there is always more to uncover”
     __________________________________________________________________

--

The Lies of Locke Lamora – 752 pages

   Matt’s Fantasy Book Reviews: “This is a fantastic fantasy novel that I
   happily can say is in my “top 10”.
   I loved everything about this book. The characters are wonderfully
   written, the world is thoroughly enjoyable (even though it’s on a very

   can horrify you one minute and then touch every heartstring in your
   being the next. That’s an incredibly tricky thing to pull off but
   Ardalan does it like a skilled maestro. If you’re tired of getting
   spoon-fed the same predictable tropes in your fantasy books, you really
   should make this book your next read. It will challenge you in a way
   that not too many fantasy books dare to. And along the way you will be
   treated to some outstanding worldbuilding, egotistical gods, magical
   creatures born of nightmares, and some of the very best writing out
   there.”
--

   I maintain that not only is Game of Thrones a brilliant read, it’s also
   an important one for the genre. It’s meaningful to talk about post-GRRM
   fantasy.

   For many people, indeed for a decent chunk of a whole. generation of
   fantasy authors, George RR Martin’s A Game of Thrones was a step change
   in the genre.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   James Tivendale for Grimdark Magazine: “The Priory of the Orange Tree
   is incredibly detailed, neatly composed and has more stunning
   set-pieces, outstanding moments and unexpected twists that most epic
   fantasy trilogies.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Master Artificer – 866 pages
--
   putting you right into the thick of it! It’s action packed, intense,
   full of fury and rage, with perfectly timed humor. It has a gritty
   darkness to it, but above all else it has a message of hope, a perfect
   marriage of both dark and light fantasy that can only be described as
   GrimHeart.”
     __________________________________________________________________

--
   PL Stuart for Before We Go Blog: “This book far exceeds the nominal
   five star rating, so no point in trying to assign it one here. The best
   compliment I can give Dragon Mage, by M.L. Spencer is: Dragon Mage is
   why I read, and love, epic fantasy.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Way of Kings – 1007 pages
--
Ash: A Secret History – 1632 pages

   “The first thing that should probably be said about Ash: A Secret
   History is that it’s probably the apex of the epic fantasy genre – or
   at least, the best thing written in the genre since The Lord of the
   Rings” – Goodreads review from Wastrel

Classic Fantasy Novels That Aren’t The Lord of the Rings

   If you love the fantasy genre (or want to explore it), add these
   classic fantasy books to your reading list! Perfect for fans of J. R.
   R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, most of these classic fantasy novels were
   written before Narnia and Middle Earth, and helped shape modern fantasy
   literature.
   Butterflies in a room backlit by a window, with the words "Classic
   Fantasy Novels (That Aren't The Lord of the Rings)" superimposed on
   top.

   I grew up steeped in fantasy literature, much of it either written by
   C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, or influenced in some way by those
   two authors. The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of
   Narnia are indeed seminal in the fantasy genre. But of course, Tolkien
   and Lewis were not the first fantasy authors on the scene, even though
   the genre was still pretty new when they were writing.

   If you’ve ever wanted to go beyond the borders of Narnia and Middle
   Earth and journey into other realms of fantasy literature, let this
   list be your guide! The first Narnia book (The Lion, the Witch, and the
   Wardrobe) was published in 1950, and the first installment of The Lord
   of the Rings was published in 1954 (although written earlier). Most of
   the books on this list of classic fantasy novels pre-date both of
   these! I hope you enjoy exploring the following authors and the worlds
   they created.

   and his imagination was baptized.

   MacDonald wrote Phantastes near the beginning of his literary career,
   and the fantasy novel Lilith near the end. Both have an amazing
   dream-like quality and are rich in symbolism. Although not connected
   they are excellent to read together, as they’re quite distinct from his
   more child-oriented fantasy novels such as The Princess and the Goblin.

   coveted textile and wallpaper patterns! As an artist, novelist, poet,
   bookmaker, and public speaker, Morris was quite the Renaissance man. In
   addition to The Wood Beyond the World, Morris wrote several other
   fantasy novels, the best of which is probably The Well at the World’s
   End. However, since The Well is much longer than The Wood Beyond the
   World, it makes sense to start with the latter, to get acclimated to
   Morris’s (intentionally) archaic style.

The Worm Ouroboros by E. R. Eddison (1922)

   The Worm Ouroboros is an epic high fantasy novel that tells of a
   sweeping war between the kingdoms of Demonland and Witchland. The
   conflict rages across land and sea, drawing in enemies and allies from
   neighbouring countries like Impland and Pixyland, as well as magical

   Although The King of Elfland’s Daughter is Dunsany’s best-known work,
   he was a prolific author, publishing nearly 100 volumes of poetry,

   Although she wrote poetry and two other novels, Lud-in-the-Mist is
   Mirrlee’s only fantasy novel. Nevertheless, her writing had its impact

   for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series.

   This series is a good pick for fans of T. H. White’s The Once and

Classic Fantasy Novels That Aren’t The Lord of the Rings

   If you love the fantasy genre (or want to explore it), add these
   classic fantasy books to your reading list! Perfect for fans of J. R.
   R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, most of these classic fantasy novels were
   written before Narnia and Middle Earth, and helped shape modern fantasy
   literature.
   Butterflies in a room backlit by a window, with the words "Classic
   Fantasy Novels (That Aren't The Lord of the Rings)" superimposed on
   top.

   I grew up steeped in fantasy literature, much of it either written by
   C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, or influenced in some way by those
   two authors. The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of
   Narnia are indeed seminal in the fantasy genre. But of course, Tolkien
   and Lewis were not the first fantasy authors on the scene, even though
   the genre was still pretty new when they were writing.

   If you’ve ever wanted to go beyond the borders of Narnia and Middle
   Earth and journey into other realms of fantasy literature, let this
   list be your guide! The first Narnia book (The Lion, the Witch, and the
   Wardrobe) was published in 1950, and the first installment of The Lord
   of the Rings was published in 1954 (although written earlier). Most of
   the books on this list of classic fantasy novels pre-date both of
   these! I hope you enjoy exploring the following authors and the worlds
   they created.

   MacDonald wrote Phantastes near the beginning of his literary career,

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:
--

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
--
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:
--
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

--
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
--
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review
--
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
--
   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:
--
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

--
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
--

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
--

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
--
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life

            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life

       Thanks for the recommendations 🙂 I know I am a bit of a broken
       record, but I am hoping to dive into some fantasy this winter, when
       I have more time and have a reason to be bundled up in the house.

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

   My Musings · Various Things

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:
--

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
--
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:
--
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

--
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
--
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review
--
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
--
   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:
--
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

--
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
--

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
--

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
--
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

Top 10 Fantasy Book Series

   My Inspirations
   6 Apr
   Written By Dominic Merrick

   Here is my list of favourite fantasy series. This list will not include
   a number of things. As with every list, this comes with a preface that
   these are my PERSONAL choices, completely idiosyncratic, with all my
   biases.
--

   The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny - really great concept and the
   plot is wild. It has some super world-building ideas and some of the
   most outlandish moments in fantasy. However, it suffers from mid-series
   lag, repetition of ideas and the characters are not so strong.

   Memory, Sorrow, Thorn by Tad Williams - classic with enough of a twist
   to make it different. The influences bleed out of this series, and it
   is steeped in fantasy tradition which is both a benefit and a downfall.
   It is saggy in many parts, including the first 200 pages of the first
   book, which is usually a fatal error. The prose is very strong and the
   cultures are interesting - ranging from Native American inspired to
--
   so-so world. Glokta the Crippled Torturer stands head and shoulders
   above all others. The plot is sometimes intriguing, sometimes
   predictable. The strongest standalone book for me is Red Country, a
   blend of fantasy and western, but nothing tops the First Law Trilogy so
   far. I met Mr Abercrombie for a book signing and he was a funny dude,
   he also helped with a research project I did at university. He is the
   first experience I had with ‘grimdark’ and probably the best with the
--

   So, maybe not a good start to include a series that is not yet
   finished, but the first three books are some of my favourite in
   fantasy. The world is vast and fantastically internally consistent, the
   plot is intricate and complex with so many brilliant twists that you
   wish you saw coming but you didn’t.

--
   has so many iconic titular characters. Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon, Jerry
   Cornelius, Michael Kane and Erekosé.

   The series has a revolutionary idea in fantasy, that existence is
   divided into two factions, LAW and CHAOS. And this has stuck with me
   throughout my writing career and bleeds into much of my work. Our hero
   fights for LAW, and is always a reincarnation of that Eternal Champion,
--

Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser by Fritz Leiber

   These short stories and novellas inspired my fantasy series, The Three
   Lovers, more than any other book. They follow the adventures of the
   titular characters in a sprawling fantasy city (Lanhkmar) and all the
   surrounding lands.

   There is a really great relationship between the two main characters,
--

   It really had everything, great plot, some of the strongest
   protagonists of all time, one of the most interesting and creative
   worlds in all fantasy, super twists and an unforgettable ending that
   keeps you thinking about it months after the fact. I can’t wait to go
   back and re-read the series, but I will wait a few years.

   It captured my heart and my imagination like no other series in recent
   years. Roland, Eddie and Susannah are some of the best characters in
   all fantasy fiction.

   It’s Stephen King at his wackiest and most creative, he throws
   everything into this series and I really do believe that it is his
--

Middle-earth by JRR Tolkien

   Lord of the Rings is the god of epic fantasy. Nothing has bettered it
   in terms of setting/world-building since its inception and I doubt they
   ever will.

--

   I’ve never come across something like it, so original in its approach,
   almost with a blatant disregard to storytelling norms, yet being
   grounded in European myth and fantasy so that it all works. Lyonesse is
   very difficult to describe, other than by saying it has everything you
   might recognise from European folklore but presented to you in a way
   you wouldn’t expect.
--

The Earthsea Cycle by Ursula K Le Guin

   When I look to how I want my first fantasy series to be, I want it to
   be like Le Guin’s Earthsea.

   I want it to have something potent to say about the themes of life,
--
   apprentice, to powerful master, to fading master and it is beautiful.

   I’ll leave the rest of my ramblings for a full review… but Earthsea is
   the Queen of Fantasy for me.

27 Subgenres of Fantasy: Find the Perfect Books for You

   ByYvonne McArthur June 9, 2025July 1, 2025 Updated onJuly 1, 2025
   An array of fantasy novels are set up on pale wooden crates in front of
   a pale green wall, arfully arranged among clay candles, an olive wood
   bowl, a maple box, and miniscule walnut candles

   All lovers of the fantasy genre know that it’s a venture into the realm
   of the fantastic and offers a range of books as vast as the
   imagination. It encompasses everything from stories about teens on a
   magical quest in present-day Virginia to Parshendi bonding spren on one
   of the planets of the Cosmere. As a fantasy writer and obsessive reader
   of the genre, I think that’s awesome. But the genre’s huge scope also
   presents a problem: It is so varied that it becomes complicated to find
   books that match our tastes.

   That’s where the subgenres of fantasy come to the rescue.

   Just as “Tex-Mex” and “Ethiopian” are sub-categories of food that give
   you a clear indication what kind of ingredients and spice profiles
   you’re in for, subgenres help us describe distinct flavors or
   sub-categories of fantasy.

   What do I mean by flavors? Well, if you like stories set in grim
   dystopian worlds full of monsters and spine-tingling chills, you might
   like dark fantasy. Whereas if you’re craving a nutty, off-the-wall tale
   that makes you laugh out loud, you’ll want to try comic fantasy.

   Think of subgenres as powerful search tools that help you find books to
   suit your tastes. For example, I love adventure and political fantasy,
   but don’t care for grimdark or romantasy. And last year, I found one of
   my new favorite books thanks to a subgenre list.

--
   each.

   If a subgenre sounds fun, jot it down, buy or borrow some of the books
   I recommend, and/or ask fantasy book clubs and communities for
   recommendations in the subgenres that pique your interest.

   Disclaimer: Think of subgenres as tags rather than boxes. Defining them
   is subjective. To borrow a line from Pirates of the Caribbean, these
   classifications are “more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual
   rules.” And just as a recipe can fall under “vegan” and “Thai” and
   “dessert”, fantasy books can be tagged under multiple subgenres.

1. High Fantasy

   Books that are high fantasy take place in completely different worlds
   from our own. Tolkien called these “secondary worlds.”

   They often include magic, mythical creatures, characters from different
--
   behind our present troubles and concerns, but we leave behind the world
   as we know it.

   High fantasy is, as Tolkien says in his essay “On Faerie Stories”, one
   of the hardest to write well because the farther we get from the rules
   and characteristics of our primary world, the more challenging it is to
   maintain an “inner consistency of reality”.
--

   I’m a fan. Can you tell?

   Examples of High Fantasy

   The Lord of the Rings is classic high fantasy. Tolkien’s Middle-earth
   is a world unto itself with a detailed and complex history, and over
   fourteen languages invented by Tolkien himself. There’s a good reason
   he’s called ‘the father of fantasy.’ Or, to riff on Brandon Sanderson,
   “Grandpa Tolkien.”

   My parents read The Lord of the Rings to me and my siblings when we
--
   where my love for the genre began.
   The wizard, Gandalf, in his flowing gray robes and pointed hat,
   striding through a blustery green meadow in the rain. The Lord of the
   Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is the signature example of the high fantasy
   subgenre. Gandalf the Gray from The Lord of the Rings—a classic example
   of high fantasy.

   Other high fantasy books I love include pretty much all of Brandon
   Sanderson’s books (I once read 25 of his books in one year.) The worlds
   he comes up with are unique, from the strange mists of Scadriel in The
   Mistborn Saga to the fascinating crustacean-inspired world of Roshar in
--
   Most of the audio versions are 50-60 hours—cue me listening at 1.75
   speed so I could finish before my library loan was due. But, Sanderson
   also has a short story collection called Arcanum Unbounded with one of
   my all-time-favorite short fantasy stories: The Emperor’s Soul. Start
   there for an intro.

   Beyond by Mercedes Lackey is another great high fantasy book.

   In YA, I’ve enjoyed the African-inspired world of Aritsar in Raybearer
   by Jordan Ifueko.
--
   story takes place in Nevermoor, a city in the First Pocket of the Free
   State.

2. Low Fantasy

   Standing in counterpoint to high fantasy, low fantasy is set in worlds
   much like our own. Low fantasy feels more grounded in reality, more
   familiar. It’s recognizable, but with a flair, a twist, something
   unexpected. It is our grandma’s shortbread with a swirl of lime zest
   and a burst of lavender flowers.

   In low fantasy, the world behaves like ours in some respects, but in
   others is shot through with the mystical, the supernatural, the
   magical. Often, the magic in these books is hidden or only accessible
   to a few people. Here we find secret societies, sentient libraries, and
   realms that are invisible to all but those who have eyes to see.

   Part of the appeal and delight of low fantasy is that the stories are
   about people much like us, with jobs and TVs and homework… but who
   encounter something fantastical: dangerous, scary, wild, enchanting,
   and almost plausible. It makes us feel like something magical could

   mica-encrusted stone and a gray and black feather. On the screen is the
   cover image of "The Raven Boys" by Maggie Stiefvater. It shows a crow,
   legs extended toward four grayed-out teen boys wearing matching
   jackets. The Raven Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy The Raven
   Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy

   Low Fantasy books often fit into other subgenres. Some common ones
   include modern, historical, urban, paranormal, and portal fantasy
   novels (which usually begin in the real world). More on those shortly.

   Examples of Low Fantasy

   The Harry Potter series contains aspects of low fantasy because every
   summer, Harry is forbidden from doing magic and is stuck in the
   non-magical, everyday world of regular Britain with his relatives.

--
   familiar but with the addition of ley lines, mythical Welsh kings, and
   dream magic.

3. Urban Fantasy

   Although it seems pretty darn obvious that urban fantasy books take
   place in—you guessed it—cities, not ALL fantasy books set in cities are
   urban. Yeah, it’s weird, I know. To be an urban fantasy, the book has
   to be set in a modern or modern-adjacent, real-world city, one where
   magic is hidden to all but a few.

   The key thing to remember is that urban fantasy is a subset of low
   fantasy. So even though The Lies of Locke Lamora takes place entirely
   in the city of Camorr, that city is not part of our world. Camorr is in
   a secondary (high fantasy) world. Thus… the book is not urban fantasy.

   Urban fantasy has a particular mystique. It’s dark with an edge of
   complexity that catches in the throat like molasses.

   Here we enter vampire lairs, solve mysteries, get lost in labyrinths,
--
   A book showing a picture of London and a train track disappearing
   underground sits in front of a dramatic painting of yellow and purple
   planet with a city of skyscrapers rising in front of it. Neverwhere is
   a great example of Urban Fantasy. Neil Gaiman’s Urban Fantasy,
   Neverwhere, is set in two versions of London: London Above and London
   Below.

   Examples of Urban Fantasy

   Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere is about a man from regular, real-world London
   who falls into the fantastical world of London Below. There, a girl
--

   Fun, right?

4. Epic Fantasy

   While the subgenres we’ve focused on so far are primarily defined by
   their setting, epic fantasy describes the story’s scope. Epics are
   epic. They are high-stakes adventures about characters who face
   overwhelming antagonistic forces: The Dark Lord Sauron with his
   far-seeing eye and hordes of orcs, immortal emperors who are impossible
--
   A carved blackwood elephant candlestick, a phone, and a tea candle
   inside a wooden holder are arranged in front of a blue, green, and gold
   scarf from Tanzania. The phone screen shows the cover image of
   "Raybearer" by Jordan Ifueko—an epic Afro-fantasy novel. Jordan
   Ifueko’s epic fantasy, Raybearer, covers sweeping world-changing events

   Usually, epic fantasies are also high fantasies, but not all high
   fantasies are epics. For example, The Goblin Emperor is a very personal
   story about one half-goblin’s unexpected rise to power and his personal
   and political struggles. It’s very much a high fantasy, but not an
   epic.

   Examples of Epic Fantasy

   By contrast, in The Lord of the Rings Frodo and Sam toil toward Mount
   Doom while Aragorn, Gandalf, and the men of Gondor draw Sauron’s eye
--
   domination. Epic.

   Sanderson’s Mistborn Saga and Stormlight Archives books also fall
   solidly under the epic fantasy subgenre, with the fate of the world
   (and the Cosmere itself) falling into the hands of the cast of
   characters.

   Likewise, in Raybearer, Tarisai is wrapped up in the politics of
   Aritsar, the fate of the empire, and of the world itself.

5. Adventure Fantasy

   Daring quests, intrepid explorers, action-packed escapades, and
   fantastic feats. Welcome to adventure fantasy, flavored with boldness,
   salted with heroics, and shot through with danger. I love this
   subgenre, probably because I love stories about journeys and wild lands
   and mythic beasts.
--
   until eventually, we prevail.
   A pen drawing of Smaug, the dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit",
   crouches over his hoard of treasure with a fierce expression. This is a
   great example of the adventure fantasy subgenre. The Hobbit is classic
   adventure fantasy

   Examples of Adventure Fantasy

   Adventure fantasies can be fun, high-flying, comedic tales like
   Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians or Howl’s Moving Castle or they could
--
   A note before going on:

   If there’s one thing you’ll notice on this literary foray, it’s that
   some subgenres of fantasy are broad, like massive umbrellas, while
   others are much tinier and more specific, like cocktail parasols.

   You’ll also notice (either here or in online bookish communities) that
--
   But don’t get lost in the fire swamp with Westley and Buttercup. You
   don’t need to memorize these names (unless you want to).

   My ultimate goal is to help you find fantasy books you like. That’s it.
   Discovering and loving The Moorchild matters a whole lot more than
   whether it’s better categorized as a mythic or fairytale fantasy.

6. Portal Fantasy

   Quick! Into the Wardrobe, past the thick fur coats, and onto the
   scrunch of snow. Look, there is a lantern shining in the woods, and
--
   travel through a portal or doorway into a magical world where they must
   adapt, confront dangers, and deal with magical forces.

   Portals merge the allure of low fantasy with high fantasy’s deep
   immersion into imaginary worlds. They bridge the magical and the
   completely ordinary. Perhaps one of us, by reading beautifully, could
   vanish into the Inkworld. And another could stare into the painting of
   a ship and be drawn suddenly aboard the Dawn Treader.

   Examples of Portal Fantasy

   My favorite portal fantasy is Enchantment by Orson Scott Card. It’s an
   adult fantasy about Ivan, a modern-day scholar who crosses a bridge
   into medieval Russia, where he meets a princess and must help her
   defeat Baba Yaga. Coming from a cross-cultural background, I love
   Card’s treatment of the cultural tensions and misunderstandings between
--
   The yellow cover of "Enchantment" appears through a circular lens. It
   shows a woman sleeping in a massive drift of leaves, surrounded by
   falling leaves and butterflies. This is a great example of a portal
   fantasy. “Now that she knew credit cards were valuable, Baba Yaga began
   to collect as many of them as she could.”
   ― Orson Scott Card, Enchantment

   One of the most well-known portal fantasy series is the Chronicles of
   Narnia by C.S. Lewis. In the first books, the Pevensie siblings travel
   through a magic wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they help
   defeat the White Witch.
--
   Cornelia Funke’s Inkheart series is a standby. What better way to enter
   a book world than through the power of language itself?

   Guy Gavriel Kay, another seminal fantasy author, wrote a portal fantasy
   trilogy called The Fionavar Tapestry. In the books, five university
   students from Toronto travel to the magical world of Fionavar, where
   they are caught up in a mythic conflict.

7. Political Fantasy

   Political fantasy books are about power and intrigue, the subtle
   machinations of governance, courts, empires, and countries. Despotic
   sorcerer kings, court scheming, military campaigns, and rebellious
   plots abound.
--

   Several of my favorite books fall under this umbrella.

   Examples of Political Fantasy

   The Goblin Emperor is a political fantasy through and through. So is
   The Queen’s Thief series (another favorite), especially The Queen of
   Attolia (book 2), The King of Attolia (book 3), and Return of the Thief
   (book six).
   Jewelry drapes across the cover of a book showing the profile of young
   man with a scarred face gripping a sword. This is one of my favorite
   political fantasy books. One of my all-time favorite political fantasy
   books

   Crown Duel, the second book in Sherwood Smith’s Crown Duel duet, is
   another of my political fantasy standbys. Spunky Meliara Astiar is
   probably the most unsubtle character you can ask for (her go-to
   behavior is to run at things with sticks and say whatever crosses her
   mind), so placing her at court leads to some fabulous mishaps.
--
   Series, and Guy Gavriel Kay’s The Sarantine Mosaic or standalone
   Tigana. All are excellent reads.

8. Dark Fantasy

   Darkness, monsters, death, gore, fear, and foreboding are common
   characteristics of this subgenre. The characters may be complex with
--
   it’s important to explore a state closer to reality.

   Confession time: this is a subgenre I’ve only dipped my toes into. Dark
   fantasy merges fantasy with horror, and horror is not my go-to vibe.
   But… I have read a few. It’s good to mix things up now and then. And
   some people love dark fantasy. You might too.
   A woman in a dark cloak with startling green eyes glares into the
   camera, while the left side of the image is obscured by the metallic
   blur of a knife. This is part of the cover of "Vespertine" by Margaret
   Rogerson. Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson is a young adult dark fantasy
   novel

   Examples of Dark Fantasy

   So, what dark fantasy books have I read and liked? Gideon the Ninth has
   a science fiction vibe and is about necromancers and their cavaliers
   (badass protectors) who have to solve a mystery in a decaying pocket
   world. The black humor and unique voice of the main character make this
   a standout book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, even if the
   blood, guts, and blobs of fat grossed me out.

   Vespertine is a young adult dark fantasy about Artemisia, a socially
   awkward teen with a traumatic past who has to defend her convent
   against the dead by wielding a relic possessed by a malevolent spirit.
   The setting is gritty, gray, and populated by corpses, but I enjoyed
   the character interactions, humorous breaks, and the snarky tone of the
   malevolent spirit.

   The Witcher is probably one of the most well-known dark fantasy series
   out there, with monster hunting, moral ambiguity, violence, corruption,
   and a grim yet likable antihero. Although I liked the stories, they do
   have explicit sexual content, which was a detractor for me.

9. Paranormal Fantasy

   Vampires, werewolves, warlocks, shadowhunters, demons, ghosts, and
   angels… It’s paranormal fantasy, popularized by the Twilight series
   (which, don’t shoot me, I haven’t read.) Paranormal fantasy is a subset
   of Urban fantasy, so they take place on our world, but are shot through
   with the supernatural.

   Here you might strike up an uneasy alliance with a vampire named
   Moriarty, learn to draw powerful runes in the fight against demons,
   speak with ghosts, and traverse energy lines in search of Welsh kings.

   Examples of Paranormal Fantasy

   Despite not reading Twilight, I have read and liked The Mortal
   Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Demon hunters in modern-day New
   York City, anyone?
   A woman holds a cell phone with a book cover on the screen. It shows a
   young man with runes pained on his arms surrounded by mythical lights.
   "City of Bones" by Cassandra Clare is a paranormal fantasy set in New
   York City. “What do you want?”
   “Just coffee. Black – like my soul.”
   ― Cassandra Clare, City of Bones
--
10. Romantasy

   All the rage these days, romantasy is a mashup of the romance and
   fantasy genres. The term is new, but fantasy romance books have been
   around a long time. So what exactly is romantasy? Well, as with lots of
   things in the literary world, definitions are subjective.

--

   Although sword and sorcery can take place in invented worlds, it
   focuses on the personal goals of one or two characters rather than the
   world-sweeping stakes and huge casts of characters of epic fantasy. The
   plots are straightforward, the technology is medieval as a rule, and
   the sorcery is usually nefarious.
   A thin albino figure leans against a tree, wielding a black sword, red
   eyes fierce. "Elric of Melniboné" by Michael Moorcock is a classic
   sword and sworcery, one of the subgenres of fantasy.

   Examples of Sword and Sorcery

--

   Books I’ve read in this subgenre include Elric of Melniboné by Michael
   Moorcock (one of the influential authors of sword and sorcery) and some
   of The Witcher books, which are also listed under dark fantasy.
   Granted, I didn’t love Elric of Melniboné, but that’s because the main
   character made choices that were so dumb I will happily rant about them
   for ten to twenty minutes.

12. Cozy Fantasy

   Have you noticed that certain subgenres are all about settings, others
   are about scope, and others are about plot devices or the presence of
--
   a book, and a plate of Welsh Griddle cakes while fog drifts past the
   windows. Some Christmas lights wouldn’t hurt.

   Cozy fantasy books embody the cozy vibe. They promise a certain kind of
   emotion: warmth, comfort, nothing too taxing, and are ultimately
   relational. The amount of conflict in a cozy can vary, but these books
   strive to maintain equilibrium between slice-of-life scenes and
   conflict.
   A book open on blankets and surrounded by fairy lights. This is an
   example of cozy fantasy.

   If you’re the kind of person who avoids books because you don’t want to
   stay up all night reading (a valid fear), cozy fantasy could be perfect
   for you. In my limited experience, they are easy to pick up, not too
   hard to put down, and sort of… peaceful.

   Examples of Cozy Fantasy

   I’ve barely dipped my toes into cozy fantasy, though I’m not opposed to
   reading more. The only book I’ve read so far that I’m sure lands in
   this subgenre has been C.J. Klune’s House on the Cerulean Sea.

--
   Sanderson’s Tress of the Emerald Sea, a whimsical tale of a girl who
   goes on a sea voyage to rescue her friend from an evil sorceress.

13. Mythic Fantasy

   Here be fairies, creatures you’ve only heard about around the campfire
   at night or from the strange old crone with an unusual herb garden and
   eyes that have seen more than you can ever know.

   Magic and myth mingle in mythic fantasy. Here you’ll encounter worlds
   populated by Greek and Roman gods, retellings of Norse myths, and
   series inspired by Slavic fairy tales.

   Books in this subgenre draw from the legends, folklore, and deities of
   cultures around the world, from the Aztecs to the Chinese to the Irish,
   and everything in between. Mythic fantasy offers fresh takes on
   familiar stories, as well as fascinating introductions to different
   worldviews and belief systems you may not have encountered before.
   An unearthly girl with while pale hair plays a bagpipe chanter. Part of
   the image is obscured by a spray of bright green fern. This is an
   example of the mythic fantasy subgenre. “Iron made her shiver, made her
   teeth ache and hurt her if she touched it.”
   The Moorchild by Eloise McGraw

   Examples of Mythic Fantasy

   One famous example of mythic fantasy is the Percy Jackson and the
   Olympians series. They are quite fun.

   Books I’ve loved in this subgenre include The Moorchild by Eloise
--
   probably fits in this genre as well, since Baba Yaga is the villain and
   there are several nods to Alexander the Great.

14. Historical Fantasy

   If you’ve ever wished you could go back in time and change a historical
   event, you might love historical fantasy.

   As you can guess, historical fantasy, much like historical fiction, is
   set during a particular historical period, and can involve real people,
   places, or events, but aside from that, pretty much anything goes.
   Magic, dragons, werewolves, battalions of sorcerers.
   A blue book with a white crackled mask and glints of fire sits on a
   blue couch. The title reads "Fawkes" by Nadine Brandes, an excellent
   example of a historical fantasy. Color magic and the Guy Fawke’s
   Gunpowder Plot meet in this young adult novel

   Examples of Historical Fiction

   There are different approaches to historical fantasy, which writer E.S.
   Foster explains as follows:

   1. Those that take place during a specific period in history, like
--
   reasons.

   3. Lastly, they can include stories that interact with the historical
   world and a fantasy world, but separately (like C.S. Lewis’ portal
   fantasy where the Pevensie children leave WWII England and travel to
   Narnia).

   If you enjoy viking stories with a strong focus on romance, you might
   enjoy Sky in the Deep by Adrienne Young.

15. Fairy Tale Fantasy

   Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named
   Cinderella. Unfortunately, her mother had passed away, leaving her
   alone with her selfish stepmother and stepsisters… cue the singing
   mice, fairy godmother, pumpkins, and glass slippers.

   Fairy tale fantasy includes classic fairy tales like Cinderella but
   also encompasses a whole realm of spinoffs, offshoots, and retellings.
   While mythic fantasy tends toward grandeur, I think of fairy tale
   fantasy as more grounded and whimsical, though they don’t necessarily
   have to be. Most of Grimm’s fairy tales are… well, grim.

   I enjoy the light reads and twists on familiar tales afforded by this
   subgenre.
   A hand holds a book in front of a branch of wood. The cover shows a
   black-haired girl with Mongolian features clutches a notebook. This is
   "Book of a Thousand Days" by Shannon Hale, a fairy-tale fantasy.

   Examples of Fairy Tale Fantasy

   For light fun reads that are very “fairy tale-esque”, check out Gail
   Carson Levine’s fairy-tale rewrites, including Ella Enchanted and
--
   secondary world inspired by Mongolia. How cool is that? I’ve read it
   many times, and it never gets old.

   Naomi Novik’s Spinning Silver is another fairy-tale fantasy worth
   checking out.

16. Nautical Fantasy

   Salty breezes, sinewy sea beasts, enchanted islands, pirates, and
   scrambling in the rigging—find it in nautical fantasy. If you’ve ever
   dreamed of sailing the high seas, felt the allure of the ocean, or
   wanted to dive for treasure, you’ll love this subgenre.

   I love nautical fantasy and need to find more books that take place at
   sea. The ocean is a world of its own, after all, full of dangers and
   the potential for high stakes conflict. Perhaps it has some cross-over
   with political fiction, too, since a ship at sea is a kingdom unto
   itself.

   Examples of Nautical Fantasy

   Here are a few of my favorites: The Liveship Traders series is a
   fantastic adult epic fantasy series about sentient ships, pirates,
   magic, and mystical islands.

   Although the first book in Sherwood Smith’s Inda series takes place on
--
   found them so engrossing that it was hard to sleep… so maybe read them
   when you’re on vacation.
   Three books in a row showing mythical ships. This is The Liveship
   Traders trilogy, excellent adult fantasy books about sentient ships and
   their human crew.

   For a less epic and more personal story, Brandon Sanderson’s standalone
--
   especially the more Caribbean vibe. Parts of the plot didn’t land for
   me, but it’s worth checking out if you enjoy young adult books.

17. Academy Fantasy/Dark Academia

   As you can guess by the name, academy fantasies take place in schools
   or academies.
--

   We’ve all been students, harped about homework, had teachers we didn’t
   get on with (and others we did), and had to muddle through exams.
   Academy fantasy takes the familiar world of academics and transports
   it, making it more awful or more fun, or at least more fantastical.

   For people still in the throes of studenthood, there is a resonance
   among the pages. For the rest of us, there’s recognition, the spark of
   old memories, maybe a modicum of nostalgia.

   Examples of Academy Fantasy

   I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the Harry Potter series here,
   which is the most famous example. (I reread these shortly before
--
   (Here be monsters)

   The Princess Academy by Shannon Hale is a light, fairytale-esque
   academy fantasy.

   Dark Academia is the gothic cousin of academy fantasy. I haven’t read
   many books in this subgenre, unless Magicians by Lev Grossman and The
   Atlas Six by Olivie Blake count. I didn’t care much for either, mostly
   because I didn’t like the characters, but I’m not opposed to trying
   other books of a similar flavor.

18. Roguish Fantasy

   Spies, thieves, pirates, assassins, and con artists let us live
   alternate lives, and you can find them all in roguish fantasy.

   These characters have often lived tough lives, been forced into morally
   compromised choices, or simply enjoy playing fast and loose with the
--
   outskirts, the world is against them, and maybe they are waging solo
   wars in the only ways they can.

   Examples of Roguish Fantasy

   If you love heist stories, check out the Riyria Revelations series by
   Michael J. Sullivan. They are my favorite books in this subgenre. Six
--
   well.
   Two cloaked figures with swords appear on the screen of a phone above
   the title "Theft of Swords." This is a fantastic heist novel in the
   roguish fantasy subgenre. Join two thieves in an edge-of-your-seat
   heist novel

   The Lies of Locke Lamora is a roguish fantasy revenge story about con
   men and thieves. (I’m not a big fan of revenge stories, but it was well
   done.)

--
   series by Sarah J. Maas, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, and An Ember in
   the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir.

19. Comic Fantasy

   We all need more laughter in our lives, and what better way to add a
   dose of endorphins than through comic fantasy? This subgenre
   encompasses the comedic, the light-hearted, the downright ridiculous,
   and the satirical.

--
   hints of the absurd, hilarious quips, and characters who bring tears of
   laughter to my eyes.

   Examples of Comic Fantasy

   Let’s all take our hats off to Sir Terry Pratchett. His Discworld
   novels are a universe unto themselves. I won’t go into which ones to
--
   his so far.
   Several exagerrated figures wearing sunglasses and enormous swords race
   across the screen of a phone, showing the cover of Alcatraz versus the
   Evil Librarians by Brandon Sanderson, a hilarious comic fantasy for
   middle-grade readers (pre-teen). “If you don’t believe what I’m telling
   you, then ask yourself this: would any decent, kind-hearted individual
   become a writer? Of course not.”
--
20. Medieval

   Knights, castles, swords, feudal systems, quests, serfs, bards, and
   overlords—find all these and more in medieval fantasy.

   If you’ve ever dreamed of snarfing down hunks of black bread, oiling
   your chain mail, jousting, or pilfering a lord’s pockets, the world of
   medieval fantasy has all this and more. There may be evil nights,
   dragons, magic swords, and dark lords.

   These books are set in the Middle Ages, or in worlds that resemble the
--

   Examples of Medieval Fantasy

   Lots of high fantasy books are Medieval, including The Lord of the
   Rings series, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, and the more
   recent The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

21. Gaslamp

   Are you craving the delicate manners and horse-drawn carriages of the
   Victorian era, plus or minus hoop skirts? Enter Gaslamp fantasy.

   This subgenre is all about Victorian-era vibes complete with historical
   settings, man servants, and strict standards of etiquette. These books

   A woman holds a phone with a black book cover dotted with white crows
   above a stylized city of London. The text reads "The Angel of the
   Crows," a gaslamp fantasy by Katherine Addison.

   Examples of Gaslamp Fantasy

   Some gaslamp fantasy novels I’ve read and enjoyed include The Infernal
   Devices series by Cassandra Clare (demon hunters in 1870s London), The
   Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison (paranormal Sherlock Holmes),
   and The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman (dragons and
--
   times I think it’d be fun to enter a world of clockwork machines,
   airships, and pneumatic tubes.

   Much like Gaslamp, steampunk fantasy is also inspired by Victorian-era
   settings, but the feel is less gothic and supernatural and more
   whimsical, adventurous, or dystopian. The technology in steampunk
   worlds can include airships, clockwork creatures or devices, steam
   technology, pneumatic tubes, goggles, and of course, some fantastical
   elements.

   Examples of Steampunk Fantasy

   I haven’t read a ton in this genre, but a series I enjoyed is Kenneth
   Oppel’s Airborn saga. It’s set in an alternate past with airships
   instead of airplanes. Protagonists Matt and Kate enjoy an airborne
   adventure that involves discovering fantasy creatures, combating
   pirates, and hunting for treasure.
   A cast iron teapot, an adjustable wrench, and black screws are arranged
   on concrete around a phone with the cover of book on the screen. It
   shows an airship and the title "Airborne" by Kenneth Oppel, a steampunk
   fantasy for middle grade readers. “Never climb a tree in a long dress,”
   Kate panted, coming up behind me.
   “I’ll remember that,” I said.”
   ― Kenneth Oppel, Airborn

23. Grimdark Fantasy

   Grimdark = Grim/powerless characters and dark worlds. One person cannot
   make a significant difference.

   Before we end… let’s chat about some additional subgenres you might
   encounter. These embody a certain ideal, and often, that ideal or
   worldview is written into the fabric of the fantasy world itself. They
   ask philosophical questions: Is the world ultimately dark or bright?
   Are we capable of effecting heroic change, or any change at all?

--

   Not so much to me, but it’s a popular subgenre.

   Examples of Grimdark Fantasy

   Although I haven’t read them, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and
   Fire is on all the Grimdark book lists I encountered while researching
--
   virtuous heroes prevail. Love, hope, and redemption win out through
   noble sacrifices.

   Examples of Noblebright Fantasy

   This term was coined by author C.J. Brightly, so if you’re interested
   in this subgenre, exploring her books is probably a good place to
   start. (I haven’t read her yet myself.)

   Much classic fantasy is considered noblebright, including The
   Chronicles of Narnia, The Chronicles of Prydain, and The Lord of the
   Rings.

   Examples of Hopepunk Fantasy

   As I mentioned in my intro, I found one of my favorite books thanks to
   the term “hopepunk,” so it’ll always hold a soft spot in my heart. That
--
   That, my friends, is the power of subgenres. And subgenre lists. And if
   you want to go even further, you can search for tropes as well.

   Katherine Addison. It is considered hopepunk fantasy by some. Me, with
   my obsessive re-read

Subgenres vs Tropes

   If we think of subgenres as sub-categories of fantasy with particular
   flavor profiles, (like Italian, Caribbean, or Chinese are
   sub-categories in the realm of cuisine), we can think of tropes as the
   common ingredients that we find across a wide range of novels.

   For example, the protagonists in many fantasy and young adult books are
   orphans. Because this story element is common across lots of books in
   the genre, it is considered a trope. And if it’s a trope you like, you
   can search for books with that particular story element (such as the
   dead parents trope common in young adult fantasy). Or, if you are
   up-to-your-ears in orphan books, you might prefer a book that doesn’t
   include that ingredient.

--

   I’m a big fan of the “found family” trope, so when I’m perusing book
   lists or asking for recommendations, I might say something like, “I
   would love to read a nautical adventure fantasy with found family and a
   forced proximity romance subplot.” And somebody might be able to
   recommend one to me.

   Cool, right?

   Check out my post on fantasy book tropes to learn to find books with
   ingredients you like.

FAQs

What genre is fantasy in the real world?

   Fantasy novels set in the real world are low fantasy. These stories
   take place in the real world, where magic is and other fantastical
   elements exist, but are often hidden. Additional subgenres in the real
   world include historical, gaslamp, steampunk, urban, and paranormal.

Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

   The subgenres of fantasy can be hard to define with exactness,
   especially as new ones emerge, fuse, and spark variations. But don’t
   stress about it. In the end, they’re nothing more than search terms to
   help us describe our reading preferences so we can find the books we
   like, recommend books to others, and discover new flavors of fantasy
   we’d like to try.

   Being able to say, “This book is a political steampunk-inspired high
   fantasy with personal stakes,” only matters if saying that inspires you
   to read it (or prevents you from reading it because you know you’d hate
   it).

   An intro to some of my favorite subgenres:

   This list of five young adult fantasy series includes political
   fantasy, academy fantasy, mythic fantasy, epic dystopian high fantasy,
   and a western-inspired high fantasy adventure series:

27 Subgenres of Fantasy: Find the Perfect Books for You

   ByYvonne McArthur June 9, 2025July 1, 2025 Updated onJuly 1, 2025
   An array of fantasy novels are set up on pale wooden crates in front of
   a pale green wall, arfully arranged among clay candles, an olive wood
   bowl, a maple box, and miniscule walnut candles

   All lovers of the fantasy genre know that it’s a venture into the realm
   of the fantastic and offers a range of books as vast as the
   imagination. It encompasses everything from stories about teens on a
   magical quest in present-day Virginia to Parshendi bonding spren on one
   of the planets of the Cosmere. As a fantasy writer and obsessive reader
   of the genre, I think that’s awesome. But the genre’s huge scope also
   presents a problem: It is so varied that it becomes complicated to find
   books that match our tastes.

   That’s where the subgenres of fantasy come to the rescue.

   Imagine asking a friend about their eating preferences so you can
   invite them over for dinner and having them say something like, “Food
--
   Just as “Tex-Mex” and “Ethiopian” are sub-categories of food that give
   you a clear indication what kind of ingredients and spice profiles
   you’re in for, subgenres help us describe distinct flavors or
   sub-categories of fantasy.

   What do I mean by flavors? Well, if you like stories set in grim
   dystopian worlds full of monsters and spine-tingling chills, you might
   like dark fantasy. Whereas if you’re craving a nutty, off-the-wall tale
   that makes you laugh out loud, you’ll want to try comic fantasy.

   Think of subgenres as powerful search tools that help you find books to
   suit your tastes. For example, I love adventure and political fantasy,
   but don’t care for grimdark or romantasy. And last year, I found one of
   my new favorite books thanks to a subgenre list.

--
   each.

   If a subgenre sounds fun, jot it down, buy or borrow some of the books
   I recommend, and/or ask fantasy book clubs and communities for
   recommendations in the subgenres that pique your interest.

   Disclaimer: Think of subgenres as tags rather than boxes. Defining them
   is subjective. To borrow a line from Pirates of the Caribbean, these
   classifications are “more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual
   rules.” And just as a recipe can fall under “vegan” and “Thai” and
   “dessert”, fantasy books can be tagged under multiple subgenres.

     * Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

1. High Fantasy

   Books that are high fantasy take place in completely different worlds
   from our own. Tolkien called these “secondary worlds.”

   They often include magic, mythical creatures, characters from different
--
   behind our present troubles and concerns, but we leave behind the world
   as we know it.

   High fantasy is, as Tolkien says in his essay “On Faerie Stories”, one
   of the hardest to write well because the farther we get from the rules
   and characteristics of our primary world, the more challenging it is to
   maintain an “inner consistency of reality”.
--

   I’m a fan. Can you tell?

   Examples of High Fantasy

   The Lord of the Rings is classic high fantasy. Tolkien’s Middle-earth
   is a world unto itself with a detailed and complex history, and over
   fourteen languages invented by Tolkien himself. There’s a good reason
   he’s called ‘the father of fantasy.’ Or, to riff on Brandon Sanderson,
   “Grandpa Tolkien.”

   My parents read The Lord of the Rings to me and my siblings when we
--
   where my love for the genre began.
   The wizard, Gandalf, in his flowing gray robes and pointed hat,
   striding through a blustery green meadow in the rain. The Lord of the
   Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is the signature example of the high fantasy
   subgenre. Gandalf the Gray from The Lord of the Rings—a classic example
   of high fantasy.

   Other high fantasy books I love include pretty much all of Brandon
   Sanderson’s books (I once read 25 of his books in one year.) The worlds
   he comes up with are unique, from the strange mists of Scadriel in The
   Mistborn Saga to the fascinating crustacean-inspired world of Roshar in
--
   Most of the audio versions are 50-60 hours—cue me listening at 1.75
   speed so I could finish before my library loan was due. But, Sanderson
   also has a short story collection called Arcanum Unbounded with one of
   my all-time-favorite short fantasy stories: The Emperor’s Soul. Start
   there for an intro.

   Beyond by Mercedes Lackey is another great high fantasy book.

   In YA, I’ve enjoyed the African-inspired world of Aritsar in Raybearer
   by Jordan Ifueko.
--
   story takes place in Nevermoor, a city in the First Pocket of the Free
   State.

2. Low Fantasy

   Standing in counterpoint to high fantasy, low fantasy is set in worlds
   much like our own. Low fantasy feels more grounded in reality, more
   familiar. It’s recognizable, but with a flair, a twist, something
   unexpected. It is our grandma’s shortbread with a swirl of lime zest
   and a burst of lavender flowers.

   In low fantasy, the world behaves like ours in some respects, but in
   others is shot through with the mystical, the supernatural, the
   magical. Often, the magic in these books is hidden or only accessible
   to a few people. Here we find secret societies, sentient libraries, and
   realms that are invisible to all but those who have eyes to see.

   Part of the appeal and delight of low fantasy is that the stories are
   about people much like us, with jobs and TVs and homework… but who
   encounter something fantastical: dangerous, scary, wild, enchanting,
   and almost plausible. It makes us feel like something magical could

   mica-encrusted stone and a gray and black feather. On the screen is the
   cover image of "The Raven Boys" by Maggie Stiefvater. It shows a crow,
   legs extended toward four grayed-out teen boys wearing matching
   jackets. The Raven Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy The Raven
   Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy

   Low Fantasy books often fit into other subgenres. Some common ones
   include modern, historical, urban, paranormal, and portal fantasy
   novels (which usually begin in the real world). More on those shortly.

   Examples of Low Fantasy

   The Harry Potter series contains aspects of low fantasy because every
   summer, Harry is forbidden from doing magic and is stuck in the
   non-magical, everyday world of regular Britain with his relatives.

--
   familiar but with the addition of ley lines, mythical Welsh kings, and
   dream magic.

3. Urban Fantasy

   Although it seems pretty darn obvious that urban fantasy books take
   place in—you guessed it—cities, not ALL fantasy books set in cities are
   urban. Yeah, it’s weird, I know. To be an urban fantasy, the book has
   to be set in a modern or modern-adjacent, real-world city, one where
   magic is hidden to all but a few.

   The key thing to remember is that urban fantasy is a subset of low
   fantasy. So even though The Lies of Locke Lamora takes place entirely
   in the city of Camorr, that city is not part of our world. Camorr is in
   a secondary (high fantasy) world. Thus… the book is not urban fantasy.

   Urban fantasy has a particular mystique. It’s dark with an edge of
   complexity that catches in the throat like molasses.

   Here we enter vampire lairs, solve mysteries, get lost in labyrinths,
--
   A book showing a picture of London and a train track disappearing
   underground sits in front of a dramatic painting of yellow and purple
   planet with a city of skyscrapers rising in front of it. Neverwhere is
   a great example of Urban Fantasy. Neil Gaiman’s Urban Fantasy,
   Neverwhere, is set in two versions of London: London Above and London
   Below.

   Examples of Urban Fantasy

   Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere is about a man from regular, real-world London
   who falls into the fantastical world of London Below. There, a girl
--

   Fun, right?

4. Epic Fantasy

   While the subgenres we’ve focused on so far are primarily defined by
   their setting, epic fantasy describes the story’s scope. Epics are
   epic. They are high-stakes adventures about characters who face
   overwhelming antagonistic forces: The Dark Lord Sauron with his
   far-seeing eye and hordes of orcs, immortal emperors who are impossible
--
   A carved blackwood elephant candlestick, a phone, and a tea candle
   inside a wooden holder are arranged in front of a blue, green, and gold
   scarf from Tanzania. The phone screen shows the cover image of
   "Raybearer" by Jordan Ifueko—an epic Afro-fantasy novel. Jordan
   Ifueko’s epic fantasy, Raybearer, covers sweeping world-changing events

   Usually, epic fantasies are also high fantasies, but not all high
   fantasies are epics. For example, The Goblin Emperor is a very personal
   story about one half-goblin’s unexpected rise to power and his personal
   and political struggles. It’s very much a high fantasy, but not an
   epic.

   Examples of Epic Fantasy

   By contrast, in The Lord of the Rings Frodo and Sam toil toward Mount
   Doom while Aragorn, Gandalf, and the men of Gondor draw Sauron’s eye
--
   domination. Epic.

   Sanderson’s Mistborn Saga and Stormlight Archives books also fall
   solidly under the epic fantasy subgenre, with the fate of the world
   (and the Cosmere itself) falling into the hands of the cast of
   characters.

   Likewise, in Raybearer, Tarisai is wrapped up in the politics of
   Aritsar, the fate of the empire, and of the world itself.

5. Adventure Fantasy

   Daring quests, intrepid explorers, action-packed escapades, and
   fantastic feats. Welcome to adventure fantasy, flavored with boldness,
   salted with heroics, and shot through with danger. I love this
   subgenre, probably because I love stories about journeys and wild lands
   and mythic beasts.
--
   until eventually, we prevail.
   A pen drawing of Smaug, the dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit",
   crouches over his hoard of treasure with a fierce expression. This is a
   great example of the adventure fantasy subgenre. The Hobbit is classic
   adventure fantasy

   Examples of Adventure Fantasy

   Adventure fantasies can be fun, high-flying, comedic tales like
   Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians or Howl’s Moving Castle or they could
--
   A note before going on:

   If there’s one thing you’ll notice on this literary foray, it’s that
   some subgenres of fantasy are broad, like massive umbrellas, while
   others are much tinier and more specific, like cocktail parasols.

   You’ll also notice (either here or in online bookish communities) that
--
   But don’t get lost in the fire swamp with Westley and Buttercup. You
   don’t need to memorize these names (unless you want to).

   My ultimate goal is to help you find fantasy books you like. That’s it.
   Discovering and loving The Moorchild matters a whole lot more than
   whether it’s better categorized as a mythic or fairytale fantasy.

6. Portal Fantasy

   Quick! Into the Wardrobe, past the thick fur coats, and onto the
   scrunch of snow. Look, there is a lantern shining in the woods, and
--
   travel through a portal or doorway into a magical world where they must
   adapt, confront dangers, and deal with magical forces.

   Portals merge the allure of low fantasy with high fantasy’s deep
   immersion into imaginary worlds. They bridge the magical and the
   completely ordinary. Perhaps one of us, by reading beautifully, could
   vanish into the Inkworld. And another could stare into the painting of
   a ship and be drawn suddenly aboard the Dawn Treader.

   Examples of Portal Fantasy

   My favorite portal fantasy is Enchantment by Orson Scott Card. It’s an
   adult fantasy about Ivan, a modern-day scholar who crosses a bridge
   into medieval Russia, where he meets a princess and must help her
   defeat Baba Yaga. Coming from a cross-cultural background, I love
   Card’s treatment of the cultural tensions and misunderstandings between
--
   The yellow cover of "Enchantment" appears through a circular lens. It
   shows a woman sleeping in a massive drift of leaves, surrounded by
   falling leaves and butterflies. This is a great example of a portal
   fantasy. “Now that she knew credit cards were valuable, Baba Yaga began
   to collect as many of them as she could.”
   ― Orson Scott Card, Enchantment

   One of the most well-known portal fantasy series is the Chronicles of
   Narnia by C.S. Lewis. In the first books, the Pevensie siblings travel
   through a magic wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they help
   defeat the White Witch.
--
   Cornelia Funke’s Inkheart series is a standby. What better way to enter
   a book world than through the power of language itself?

   Guy Gavriel Kay, another seminal fantasy author, wrote a portal fantasy
   trilogy called The Fionavar Tapestry. In the books, five university
   students from Toronto travel to the magical world of Fionavar, where
   they are caught up in a mythic conflict.

7. Political Fantasy

   Political fantasy books are about power and intrigue, the subtle
   machinations of governance, courts, empires, and countries. Despotic
   sorcerer kings, court scheming, military campaigns, and rebellious
   plots abound.
--

   Several of my favorite books fall under this umbrella.

   Examples of Political Fantasy

   The Goblin Emperor is a political fantasy through and through. So is
   The Queen’s Thief series (another favorite), especially The Queen of
   Attolia (book 2), The King of Attolia (book 3), and Return of the Thief
   (book six).
   Jewelry drapes across the cover of a book showing the profile of young
   man with a scarred face gripping a sword. This is one of my favorite
   political fantasy books. One of my all-time favorite political fantasy
   books

   Crown Duel, the second book in Sherwood Smith’s Crown Duel duet, is
   another of my political fantasy standbys. Spunky Meliara Astiar is
   probably the most unsubtle character you can ask for (her go-to
   behavior is to run at things with sticks and say whatever crosses her
   mind), so placing her at court leads to some fabulous mishaps.
--
   Series, and Guy Gavriel Kay’s The Sarantine Mosaic or standalone
   Tigana. All are excellent reads.

8. Dark Fantasy

   Darkness, monsters, death, gore, fear, and foreboding are common
   characteristics of this subgenre. The characters may be complex with
--
   it’s important to explore a state closer to reality.

   Confession time: this is a subgenre I’ve only dipped my toes into. Dark
   fantasy merges fantasy with horror, and horror is not my go-to vibe.
   But… I have read a few. It’s good to mix things up now and then. And
   some people love dark fantasy. You might too.
   A woman in a dark cloak with startling green eyes glares into the
   camera, while the left side of the image is obscured by the metallic
   blur of a knife. This is part of the cover of "Vespertine" by Margaret
   Rogerson. Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson is a young adult dark fantasy
   novel

   Examples of Dark Fantasy

   So, what dark fantasy books have I read and liked? Gideon the Ninth has
   a science fiction vibe and is about necromancers and their cavaliers
   (badass protectors) who have to solve a mystery in a decaying pocket
   world. The black humor and unique voice of the main character make this
   a standout book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, even if the
   blood, guts, and blobs of fat grossed me out.

   Vespertine is a young adult dark fantasy about Artemisia, a socially
   awkward teen with a traumatic past who has to defend her convent
   against the dead by wielding a relic possessed by a malevolent spirit.
   The setting is gritty, gray, and populated by corpses, but I enjoyed
   the character interactions, humorous breaks, and the snarky tone of the
   malevolent spirit.

   The Witcher is probably one of the most well-known dark fantasy series
   out there, with monster hunting, moral ambiguity, violence, corruption,
   and a grim yet likable antihero. Although I liked the stories, they do
   have explicit sexual content, which was a detractor for me.

9. Paranormal Fantasy

   Vampires, werewolves, warlocks, shadowhunters, demons, ghosts, and
   angels… It’s paranormal fantasy, popularized by the Twilight series
   (which, don’t shoot me, I haven’t read.) Paranormal fantasy is a subset
   of Urban fantasy, so they take place on our world, but are shot through
   with the supernatural.

   Here you might strike up an uneasy alliance with a vampire named
   Moriarty, learn to draw powerful runes in the fight against demons,
   speak with ghosts, and traverse energy lines in search of Welsh kings.

   Examples of Paranormal Fantasy

   Despite not reading Twilight, I have read and liked The Mortal
   Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Demon hunters in modern-day New
   York City, anyone?
   A woman holds a cell phone with a book cover on the screen. It shows a
   young man with runes pained on his arms surrounded by mythical lights.
   "City of Bones" by Cassandra Clare is a paranormal fantasy set in New
   York City. “What do you want?”
   “Just coffee. Black – like my soul.”
   ― Cassandra Clare, City of Bones
--
10. Romantasy

   All the rage these days, romantasy is a mashup of the romance and
   fantasy genres. The term is new, but fantasy romance books have been
   around a long time. So what exactly is romantasy? Well, as with lots of
   things in the literary world, definitions are subjective.

--

   Although sword and sorcery can take place in invented worlds, it
   focuses on the personal goals of one or two characters rather than the
   world-sweeping stakes and huge casts of characters of epic fantasy. The
   plots are straightforward, the technology is medieval as a rule, and
   the sorcery is usually nefarious.
   A thin albino figure leans against a tree, wielding a black sword, red
   eyes fierce. "Elric of Melniboné" by Michael Moorcock is a classic
   sword and sworcery, one of the subgenres of fantasy.

   Examples of Sword and Sorcery

--

   Books I’ve read in this subgenre include Elric of Melniboné by Michael
   Moorcock (one of the influential authors of sword and sorcery) and some
   of The Witcher books, which are also listed under dark fantasy.
   Granted, I didn’t love Elric of Melniboné, but that’s because the main
   character made choices that were so dumb I will happily rant about them
   for ten to twenty minutes.

12. Cozy Fantasy

   Have you noticed that certain subgenres are all about settings, others
   are about scope, and others are about plot devices or the presence of
--
   a book, and a plate of Welsh Griddle cakes while fog drifts past the
   windows. Some Christmas lights wouldn’t hurt.

   Cozy fantasy books embody the cozy vibe. They promise a certain kind of
   emotion: warmth, comfort, nothing too taxing, and are ultimately
   relational. The amount of conflict in a cozy can vary, but these books
   strive to maintain equilibrium between slice-of-life scenes and
   conflict.
   A book open on blankets and surrounded by fairy lights. This is an
   example of cozy fantasy.

   If you’re the kind of person who avoids books because you don’t want to
   stay up all night reading (a valid fear), cozy fantasy could be perfect
   for you. In my limited experience, they are easy to pick up, not too
   hard to put down, and sort of… peaceful.

   Examples of Cozy Fantasy

   I’ve barely dipped my toes into cozy fantasy, though I’m not opposed to
   reading more. The only book I’ve read so far that I’m sure lands in
   this subgenre has been C.J. Klune’s House on the Cerulean Sea.

--
   Sanderson’s Tress of the Emerald Sea, a whimsical tale of a girl who
   goes on a sea voyage to rescue her friend from an evil sorceress.

13. Mythic Fantasy

   Here be fairies, creatures you’ve only heard about around the campfire
   at night or from the strange old crone with an unusual herb garden and
   eyes that have seen more than you can ever know.

   Magic and myth mingle in mythic fantasy. Here you’ll encounter worlds
   populated by Greek and Roman gods, retellings of Norse myths, and
   series inspired by Slavic fairy tales.

   Books in this subgenre draw from the legends, folklore, and deities of
   cultures around the world, from the Aztecs to the Chinese to the Irish,
   and everything in between. Mythic fantasy offers fresh takes on
   familiar stories, as well as fascinating introductions to different
   worldviews and belief systems you may not have encountered before.
   An unearthly girl with while pale hair plays a bagpipe chanter. Part of
   the image is obscured by a spray of bright green fern. This is an
   example of the mythic fantasy subgenre. “Iron made her shiver, made her
   teeth ache and hurt her if she touched it.”
   The Moorchild by Eloise McGraw

   Examples of Mythic Fantasy

   One famous example of mythic fantasy is the Percy Jackson and the
   Olympians series. They are quite fun.

   Books I’ve loved in this subgenre include The Moorchild by Eloise
--
   probably fits in this genre as well, since Baba Yaga is the villain and
   there are several nods to Alexander the Great.

14. Historical Fantasy

   If you’ve ever wished you could go back in time and change a historical
   event, you might love historical fantasy.

   As you can guess, historical fantasy, much like historical fiction, is
   set during a particular historical period, and can involve real people,
   places, or events, but aside from that, pretty much anything goes.
   Magic, dragons, werewolves, battalions of sorcerers.
   A blue book with a white crackled mask and glints of fire sits on a
   blue couch. The title reads "Fawkes" by Nadine Brandes, an excellent
   example of a historical fantasy. Color magic and the Guy Fawke’s
   Gunpowder Plot meet in this young adult novel

   Examples of Historical Fiction

   There are different approaches to historical fantasy, which writer E.S.
   Foster explains as follows:

   1. Those that take place during a specific period in history, like
--
   reasons.

   3. Lastly, they can include stories that interact with the historical
   world and a fantasy world, but separately (like C.S. Lewis’ portal
   fantasy where the Pevensie children leave WWII England and travel to
   Narnia).

   If you enjoy viking stories with a strong focus on romance, you might
   enjoy Sky in the Deep by Adrienne Young.

15. Fairy Tale Fantasy

   Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named
   Cinderella. Unfortunately, her mother had passed away, leaving her
   alone with her selfish stepmother and stepsisters… cue the singing
   mice, fairy godmother, pumpkins, and glass slippers.

   Fairy tale fantasy includes classic fairy tales like Cinderella but
   also encompasses a whole realm of spinoffs, offshoots, and retellings.
   While mythic fantasy tends toward grandeur, I think of fairy tale
   fantasy as more grounded and whimsical, though they don’t necessarily
   have to be. Most of Grimm’s fairy tales are… well, grim.

   I enjoy the light reads and twists on familiar tales afforded by this
   subgenre.
   A hand holds a book in front of a branch of wood. The cover shows a
   black-haired girl with Mongolian features clutches a notebook. This is
   "Book of a Thousand Days" by Shannon Hale, a fairy-tale fantasy.

   Examples of Fairy Tale Fantasy

   For light fun reads that are very “fairy tale-esque”, check out Gail
   Carson Levine’s fairy-tale rewrites, including Ella Enchanted and
--
   secondary world inspired by Mongolia. How cool is that? I’ve read it
   many times, and it never gets old.

   Naomi Novik’s Spinning Silver is another fairy-tale fantasy worth
   checking out.

16. Nautical Fantasy

   Salty breezes, sinewy sea beasts, enchanted islands, pirates, and
   scrambling in the rigging—find it in nautical fantasy. If you’ve ever
   dreamed of sailing the high seas, felt the allure of the ocean, or
   wanted to dive for treasure, you’ll love this subgenre.

   I love nautical fantasy and need to find more books that take place at
   sea. The ocean is a world of its own, after all, full of dangers and
   the potential for high stakes conflict. Perhaps it has some cross-over
   with political fiction, too, since a ship at sea is a kingdom unto
   itself.

   Examples of Nautical Fantasy

   Here are a few of my favorites: The Liveship Traders series is a
   fantastic adult epic fantasy series about sentient ships, pirates,
   magic, and mystical islands.

   Although the first book in Sherwood Smith’s Inda series takes place on
--
   found them so engrossing that it was hard to sleep… so maybe read them
   when you’re on vacation.
   Three books in a row showing mythical ships. This is The Liveship
   Traders trilogy, excellent adult fantasy books about sentient ships and
   their human crew.

   For a less epic and more personal story, Brandon Sanderson’s standalone
--
   especially the more Caribbean vibe. Parts of the plot didn’t land for
   me, but it’s worth checking out if you enjoy young adult books.

17. Academy Fantasy/Dark Academia

   As you can guess by the name, academy fantasies take place in schools
   or academies.
--

   We’ve all been students, harped about homework, had teachers we didn’t
   get on with (and others we did), and had to muddle through exams.
   Academy fantasy takes the familiar world of academics and transports
   it, making it more awful or more fun, or at least more fantastical.

   For people still in the throes of studenthood, there is a resonance
   among the pages. For the rest of us, there’s recognition, the spark of
   old memories, maybe a modicum of nostalgia.

   Examples of Academy Fantasy

   I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the Harry Potter series here,
   which is the most famous example. (I reread these shortly before
--
   (Here be monsters)

   The Princess Academy by Shannon Hale is a light, fairytale-esque
   academy fantasy.

   Dark Academia is the gothic cousin of academy fantasy. I haven’t read
   many books in this subgenre, unless Magicians by Lev Grossman and The
   Atlas Six by Olivie Blake count. I didn’t care much for either, mostly
   because I didn’t like the characters, but I’m not opposed to trying
   other books of a similar flavor.

18. Roguish Fantasy

   Spies, thieves, pirates, assassins, and con artists let us live
   alternate lives, and you can find them all in roguish fantasy.

   These characters have often lived tough lives, been forced into morally
   compromised choices, or simply enjoy playing fast and loose with the
--
   outskirts, the world is against them, and maybe they are waging solo
   wars in the only ways they can.

   Examples of Roguish Fantasy

   If you love heist stories, check out the Riyria Revelations series by
   Michael J. Sullivan. They are my favorite books in this subgenre. Six
--
   well.
   Two cloaked figures with swords appear on the screen of a phone above
   the title "Theft of Swords." This is a fantastic heist novel in the
   roguish fantasy subgenre. Join two thieves in an edge-of-your-seat
   heist novel

   The Lies of Locke Lamora is a roguish fantasy revenge story about con
   men and thieves. (I’m not a big fan of revenge stories, but it was well
   done.)

--
   series by Sarah J. Maas, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, and An Ember in
   the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir.

19. Comic Fantasy

   We all need more laughter in our lives, and what better way to add a
   dose of endorphins than through comic fantasy? This subgenre
   encompasses the comedic, the light-hearted, the downright ridiculous,
   and the satirical.

--
   hints of the absurd, hilarious quips, and characters who bring tears of
   laughter to my eyes.

   Examples of Comic Fantasy

   Let’s all take our hats off to Sir Terry Pratchett. His Discworld
   novels are a universe unto themselves. I won’t go into which ones to
--
   his so far.
   Several exagerrated figures wearing sunglasses and enormous swords race
   across the screen of a phone, showing the cover of Alcatraz versus the
   Evil Librarians by Brandon Sanderson, a hilarious comic fantasy for
   middle-grade readers (pre-teen). “If you don’t believe what I’m telling
   you, then ask yourself this: would any decent, kind-hearted individual
   become a writer? Of course not.”
--
20. Medieval

   Knights, castles, swords, feudal systems, quests, serfs, bards, and
   overlords—find all these and more in medieval fantasy.

   If you’ve ever dreamed of snarfing down hunks of black bread, oiling
   your chain mail, jousting, or pilfering a lord’s pockets, the world of
   medieval fantasy has all this and more. There may be evil nights,
   dragons, magic swords, and dark lords.

   These books are set in the Middle Ages, or in worlds that resemble the
--
   technology.
   A woman in a black dress lifts a sword dramatically. This is the cover
   of "The Beauty of Darkness" the final book in "The Remnant Chronicles"
   by Mary E. Pearson. This is as example of medieval fantasy.

   Examples of Medieval Fantasy

   Lots of high fantasy books are Medieval, including The Lord of the
   Rings series, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, and the more
   recent The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

--
21. Gaslamp

   Are you craving the delicate manners and horse-drawn carriages of the
   Victorian era, plus or minus hoop skirts? Enter Gaslamp fantasy.

   This subgenre is all about Victorian-era vibes complete with historical
   settings, man servants, and strict standards of etiquette. These books
--
   magic.
   A woman holds a phone with a black book cover dotted with white crows
   above a stylized city of London. The text reads "The Angel of the
   Crows," a gaslamp fantasy by Katherine Addison.

   Examples of Gaslamp Fantasy

   Some gaslamp fantasy novels I’ve read and enjoyed include The Infernal
   Devices series by Cassandra Clare (demon hunters in 1870s London), The
   Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison (paranormal Sherlock Holmes),
   and The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman (dragons and
--
   times I think it’d be fun to enter a world of clockwork machines,
   airships, and pneumatic tubes.

   Much like Gaslamp, steampunk fantasy is also inspired by Victorian-era
   settings, but the feel is less gothic and supernatural and more
   whimsical, adventurous, or dystopian. The technology in steampunk
   worlds can include airships, clockwork creatures or devices, steam
   technology, pneumatic tubes, goggles, and of course, some fantastical
   elements.

   Examples of Steampunk Fantasy

   I haven’t read a ton in this genre, but a series I enjoyed is Kenneth
   Oppel’s Airborn saga. It’s set in an alternate past with airships
   instead of airplanes. Protagonists Matt and Kate enjoy an airborne
   adventure that involves discovering fantasy creatures, combating
   pirates, and hunting for treasure.
   A cast iron teapot, an adjustable wrench, and black screws are arranged
   on concrete around a phone with the cover of book on the screen. It
   shows an airship and the title "Airborne" by Kenneth Oppel, a steampunk
   fantasy for middle grade readers. “Never climb a tree in a long dress,”
   Kate panted, coming up behind me.
   “I’ll remember that,” I said.”
   ― Kenneth Oppel, Airborn

23. Grimdark Fantasy

   Grimdark = Grim/powerless characters and dark worlds. One person cannot
   make a significant difference.

   Before we end… let’s chat about some additional subgenres you might
   encounter. These embody a certain ideal, and often, that ideal or
   worldview is written into the fabric of the fantasy world itself. They
   ask philosophical questions: Is the world ultimately dark or bright?
   Are we capable of effecting heroic change, or any change at all?

--

   Not so much to me, but it’s a popular subgenre.

   Examples of Grimdark Fantasy

   Although I haven’t read them, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and
   Fire is on all the Grimdark book lists I encountered while researching
--
   virtuous heroes prevail. Love, hope, and redemption win out through
   noble sacrifices.

   Examples of Noblebright Fantasy

   This term was coined by author C.J. Brightly, so if you’re interested
   in this subgenre, exploring her books is probably a good place to
   start. (I haven’t read her yet myself.)

   Much classic fantasy is considered noblebright, including The
   Chronicles of Narnia, The Chronicles of Prydain, and The Lord of the
   Rings.
   The distant figures of the Fellowship of the Ring make their way
--
   embraces hope. But maybe it’s just an edgier version of noblebright?

   Examples of Hopepunk Fantasy

   As I mentioned in my intro, I found one of my favorite books thanks to
   the term “hopepunk,” so it’ll always hold a soft spot in my heart. That
--
   That, my friends, is the power of subgenres. And subgenre lists. And if
   you want to go even further, you can search for tropes as well.
   Yvonne with one of her favorite books, "The Goblin Emperor" by
   Katherine Addison. It is considered hopepunk fantasy by some. Me, with
   my obsessive re-read

Subgenres vs Tropes

   If we think of subgenres as sub-categories of fantasy with particular
   flavor profiles, (like Italian, Caribbean, or Chinese are
   sub-categories in the realm of cuisine), we can think of tropes as the
   common ingredients that we find across a wide range of novels.

   For example, the protagonists in many fantasy and young adult books are
   orphans. Because this story element is common across lots of books in
   the genre, it is considered a trope. And if it’s a trope you like, you
   can search for books with that particular story element (such as the
   dead parents trope common in young adult fantasy). Or, if you are
   up-to-your-ears in orphan books, you might prefer a book that doesn’t
   include that ingredient.

--

   I’m a big fan of the “found family” trope, so when I’m perusing book
   lists or asking for recommendations, I might say something like, “I
   would love to read a nautical adventure fantasy with found family and a
   forced proximity romance subplot.” And somebody might be able to
   recommend one to me.

   Cool, right?

   Check out my post on fantasy book tropes to learn to find books with
   ingredients you like.

FAQs

What genre is fantasy in the real world?

   Fantasy novels set in the real world are low fantasy. These stories
   take place in the real world, where magic is and other fantastical
   elements exist, but are often hidden. Additional subgenres in the real
   world include historical, gaslamp, steampunk, urban, and paranormal.

Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

   The subgenres of fantasy can be hard to define with exactness,
   especially as new ones emerge, fuse, and spark variations. But don’t
   stress about it. In the end, they’re nothing more than search terms to
   help us describe our reading preferences so we can find the books we
   like, recommend books to others, and discover new flavors of fantasy
   we’d like to try.

   Being able to say, “This book is a political steampunk-inspired high
   fantasy with personal stakes,” only matters if saying that inspires you
   to read it (or prevents you from reading it because you know you’d hate
   it).

   An intro to some of my favorite subgenres:

   This list of five young adult fantasy series includes political
   fantasy, academy fantasy, mythic fantasy, epic dystopian high fantasy,
   and a western-inspired high fantasy adventure series:

27 Subgenres of Fantasy: Find the Perfect Books for You

   ByYvonne McArthur June 9, 2025July 1, 2025 Updated onJuly 1, 2025
   An array of fantasy novels are set up on pale wooden crates in front of
   a pale green wall, arfully arranged among clay candles, an olive wood
   bowl, a maple box, and miniscule walnut candles

   All lovers of the fantasy genre know that it’s a venture into the realm
   of the fantastic and offers a range of books as vast as the
   imagination. It encompasses everything from stories about teens on a
   magical quest in present-day Virginia to Parshendi bonding spren on one
   of the planets of the Cosmere. As a fantasy writer and obsessive reader
   of the genre, I think that’s awesome. But the genre’s huge scope also
   presents a problem: It is so varied that it becomes complicated to find
   books that match our tastes.

   That’s where the subgenres of fantasy come to the rescue.

   Imagine asking a friend about their eating preferences so you can
   invite them over for dinner and having them say something like, “Food
--
   Just as “Tex-Mex” and “Ethiopian” are sub-categories of food that give
   you a clear indication what kind of ingredients and spice profiles
   you’re in for, subgenres help us describe distinct flavors or
   sub-categories of fantasy.

   What do I mean by flavors? Well, if you like stories set in grim
   dystopian worlds full of monsters and spine-tingling chills, you might
   like dark fantasy. Whereas if you’re craving a nutty, off-the-wall tale
   that makes you laugh out loud, you’ll want to try comic fantasy.

   Think of subgenres as powerful search tools that help you find books to
   suit your tastes. For example, I love adventure and political fantasy,
   but don’t care for grimdark or romantasy. And last year, I found one of
   my new favorite books thanks to a subgenre list.

--
   each.

   If a subgenre sounds fun, jot it down, buy or borrow some of the books
   I recommend, and/or ask fantasy book clubs and communities for
   recommendations in the subgenres that pique your interest.

   Disclaimer: Think of subgenres as tags rather than boxes. Defining them
   is subjective. To borrow a line from Pirates of the Caribbean, these
   classifications are “more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual
   rules.” And just as a recipe can fall under “vegan” and “Thai” and
   “dessert”, fantasy books can be tagged under multiple subgenres.

     * Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

1. High Fantasy

   Books that are high fantasy take place in completely different worlds
   from our own. Tolkien called these “secondary worlds.”

   They often include magic, mythical creatures, characters from different
--
   behind our present troubles and concerns, but we leave behind the world
   as we know it.

   High fantasy is, as Tolkien says in his essay “On Faerie Stories”, one
   of the hardest to write well because the farther we get from the rules
   and characteristics of our primary world, the more challenging it is to
   maintain an “inner consistency of reality”.
--

   I’m a fan. Can you tell?

   Examples of High Fantasy

   The Lord of the Rings is classic high fantasy. Tolkien’s Middle-earth
   is a world unto itself with a detailed and complex history, and over
   fourteen languages invented by Tolkien himself. There’s a good reason
   he’s called ‘the father of fantasy.’ Or, to riff on Brandon Sanderson,
   “Grandpa Tolkien.”

   My parents read The Lord of the Rings to me and my siblings when we
--
   where my love for the genre began.
   The wizard, Gandalf, in his flowing gray robes and pointed hat,
   striding through a blustery green meadow in the rain. The Lord of the
   Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is the signature example of the high fantasy
   subgenre. Gandalf the Gray from The Lord of the Rings—a classic example
   of high fantasy.

   Other high fantasy books I love include pretty much all of Brandon
   Sanderson’s books (I once read 25 of his books in one year.) The worlds
   he comes up with are unique, from the strange mists of Scadriel in The
   Mistborn Saga to the fascinating crustacean-inspired world of Roshar in
--
   Most of the audio versions are 50-60 hours—cue me listening at 1.75
   speed so I could finish before my library loan was due. But, Sanderson
   also has a short story collection called Arcanum Unbounded with one of
   my all-time-favorite short fantasy stories: The Emperor’s Soul. Start
   there for an intro.

   Beyond by Mercedes Lackey is another great high fantasy book.

   In YA, I’ve enjoyed the African-inspired world of Aritsar in Raybearer
   by Jordan Ifueko.
--
   story takes place in Nevermoor, a city in the First Pocket of the Free
   State.

2. Low Fantasy

   Standing in counterpoint to high fantasy, low fantasy is set in worlds
   much like our own. Low fantasy feels more grounded in reality, more
   familiar. It’s recognizable, but with a flair, a twist, something
   unexpected. It is our grandma’s shortbread with a swirl of lime zest
   and a burst of lavender flowers.

   In low fantasy, the world behaves like ours in some respects, but in
   others is shot through with the mystical, the supernatural, the
   magical. Often, the magic in these books is hidden or only accessible
   to a few people. Here we find secret societies, sentient libraries, and
   realms that are invisible to all but those who have eyes to see.

   Part of the appeal and delight of low fantasy is that the stories are
   about people much like us, with jobs and TVs and homework… but who
   encounter something fantastical: dangerous, scary, wild, enchanting,
   and almost plausible. It makes us feel like something magical could

   mica-encrusted stone and a gray and black feather. On the screen is the
   cover image of "The Raven Boys" by Maggie Stiefvater. It shows a crow,
   legs extended toward four grayed-out teen boys wearing matching
   jackets. The Raven Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy The Raven
   Boys is a great example of Low Fantasy

   Low Fantasy books often fit into other subgenres. Some common ones
   include modern, historical, urban, paranormal, and portal fantasy
   novels (which usually begin in the real world). More on those shortly.

   Examples of Low Fantasy

   The Harry Potter series contains aspects of low fantasy because every
   summer, Harry is forbidden from doing magic and is stuck in the
   non-magical, everyday world of regular Britain with his relatives.

--
   familiar but with the addition of ley lines, mythical Welsh kings, and
   dream magic.

3. Urban Fantasy

   Although it seems pretty darn obvious that urban fantasy books take
   place in—you guessed it—cities, not ALL fantasy books set in cities are
   urban. Yeah, it’s weird, I know. To be an urban fantasy, the book has
   to be set in a modern or modern-adjacent, real-world city, one where
   magic is hidden to all but a few.

   The key thing to remember is that urban fantasy is a subset of low
   fantasy. So even though The Lies of Locke Lamora takes place entirely
   in the city of Camorr, that city is not part of our world. Camorr is in
   a secondary (high fantasy) world. Thus… the book is not urban fantasy.

   Urban fantasy has a particular mystique. It’s dark with an edge of
   complexity that catches in the throat like molasses.

   Here we enter vampire lairs, solve mysteries, get lost in labyrinths,
--
   A book showing a picture of London and a train track disappearing
   underground sits in front of a dramatic painting of yellow and purple
   planet with a city of skyscrapers rising in front of it. Neverwhere is
   a great example of Urban Fantasy. Neil Gaiman’s Urban Fantasy,
   Neverwhere, is set in two versions of London: London Above and London
   Below.

   Examples of Urban Fantasy

   Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere is about a man from regular, real-world London
   who falls into the fantastical world of London Below. There, a girl
--

   Fun, right?

4. Epic Fantasy

   While the subgenres we’ve focused on so far are primarily defined by
   their setting, epic fantasy describes the story’s scope. Epics are
   epic. They are high-stakes adventures about characters who face
   overwhelming antagonistic forces: The Dark Lord Sauron with his
   far-seeing eye and hordes of orcs, immortal emperors who are impossible
--
   A carved blackwood elephant candlestick, a phone, and a tea candle
   inside a wooden holder are arranged in front of a blue, green, and gold
   scarf from Tanzania. The phone screen shows the cover image of
   "Raybearer" by Jordan Ifueko—an epic Afro-fantasy novel. Jordan
   Ifueko’s epic fantasy, Raybearer, covers sweeping world-changing events

   Usually, epic fantasies are also high fantasies, but not all high
   fantasies are epics. For example, The Goblin Emperor is a very personal
   story about one half-goblin’s unexpected rise to power and his personal
   and political struggles. It’s very much a high fantasy, but not an
   epic.

   Examples of Epic Fantasy

   By contrast, in The Lord of the Rings Frodo and Sam toil toward Mount
   Doom while Aragorn, Gandalf, and the men of Gondor draw Sauron’s eye

   domination. Epic.

   Sanderson’s Mistborn Saga and Stormlight Archives books also fall
   solidly under the epic fantasy subgenre, with the fate of the world
   (and the Cosmere itself) falling into the hands of the cast of
   characters.

   Likewise, in Raybearer, Tarisai is wrapped up in the politics of
   Aritsar, the fate of the empire, and of the world itself.

5. Adventure Fantasy

   Daring quests, intrepid explorers, action-packed escapades, and
   fantastic feats. Welcome to adventure fantasy, flavored with boldness,
   salted with heroics, and shot through with danger. I love this
   subgenre, probably because I love stories about journeys and wild lands
   and mythic beasts.
--
   until eventually, we prevail.
   A pen drawing of Smaug, the dragon from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit",
   crouches over his hoard of treasure with a fierce expression. This is a
   great example of the adventure fantasy subgenre. The Hobbit is classic
   adventure fantasy

   Examples of Adventure Fantasy

   Adventure fantasies can be fun, high-flying, comedic tales like
   Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians or Howl’s Moving Castle or they could
--
   A note before going on:

   If there’s one thing you’ll notice on this literary foray, it’s that
   some subgenres of fantasy are broad, like massive umbrellas, while
   others are much tinier and more specific, like cocktail parasols.

   You’ll also notice (either here or in online bookish communities) that
--
   But don’t get lost in the fire swamp with Westley and Buttercup. You
   don’t need to memorize these names (unless you want to).

   My ultimate goal is to help you find fantasy books you like. That’s it.
   Discovering and loving The Moorchild matters a whole lot more than
   whether it’s better categorized as a mythic or fairytale fantasy.

6. Portal Fantasy

   Quick! Into the Wardrobe, past the thick fur coats, and onto the
   scrunch of snow. Look, there is a lantern shining in the woods, and
--
   travel through a portal or doorway into a magical world where they must
   adapt, confront dangers, and deal with magical forces.

   Portals merge the allure of low fantasy with high fantasy’s deep
   immersion into imaginary worlds. They bridge the magical and the
   completely ordinary. Perhaps one of us, by reading beautifully, could
   vanish into the Inkworld. And another could stare into the painting of
   a ship and be drawn suddenly aboard the Dawn Treader.

   Examples of Portal Fantasy

   My favorite portal fantasy is Enchantment by Orson Scott Card. It’s an
   adult fantasy about Ivan, a modern-day scholar who crosses a bridge
   into medieval Russia, where he meets a princess and must help her
   defeat Baba Yaga. Coming from a cross-cultural background, I love
   Card’s treatment of the cultural tensions and misunderstandings between
--
   The yellow cover of "Enchantment" appears through a circular lens. It
   shows a woman sleeping in a massive drift of leaves, surrounded by
   falling leaves and butterflies. This is a great example of a portal
   fantasy. “Now that she knew credit cards were valuable, Baba Yaga began
   to collect as many of them as she could.”
   ― Orson Scott Card, Enchantment

   One of the most well-known portal fantasy series is the Chronicles of
   Narnia by C.S. Lewis. In the first books, the Pevensie siblings travel
   through a magic wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they help
   defeat the White Witch.
--
   Cornelia Funke’s Inkheart series is a standby. What better way to enter
   a book world than through the power of language itself?

   Guy Gavriel Kay, another seminal fantasy author, wrote a portal fantasy
   trilogy called The Fionavar Tapestry. In the books, five university
   students from Toronto travel to the magical world of Fionavar, where
   they are caught up in a mythic conflict.

7. Political Fantasy

   Political fantasy books are about power and intrigue, the subtle
   machinations of governance, courts, empires, and countries. Despotic
   sorcerer kings, court scheming, military campaigns, and rebellious
   plots abound.
--

   Several of my favorite books fall under this umbrella.

   Examples of Political Fantasy

   The Goblin Emperor is a political fantasy through and through. So is
   The Queen’s Thief series (another favorite), especially The Queen of
   Attolia (book 2), The King of Attolia (book 3), and Return of the Thief
   (book six).
   Jewelry drapes across the cover of a book showing the profile of young
   man with a scarred face gripping a sword. This is one of my favorite
   political fantasy books. One of my all-time favorite political fantasy
   books

   Crown Duel, the second book in Sherwood Smith’s Crown Duel duet, is
   another of my political fantasy standbys. Spunky Meliara Astiar is
   probably the most unsubtle character you can ask for (her go-to
   behavior is to run at things with sticks and say whatever crosses her
   mind), so placing her at court leads to some fabulous mishaps.
--
   Series, and Guy Gavriel Kay’s The Sarantine Mosaic or standalone
   Tigana. All are excellent reads.

8. Dark Fantasy

   Darkness, monsters, death, gore, fear, and foreboding are common
   characteristics of this subgenre. The characters may be complex with
--
   it’s important to explore a state closer to reality.

   Confession time: this is a subgenre I’ve only dipped my toes into. Dark
   fantasy merges fantasy with horror, and horror is not my go-to vibe.
   But… I have read a few. It’s good to mix things up now and then. And
   some people love dark fantasy. You might too.
   A woman in a dark cloak with startling green eyes glares into the
   camera, while the left side of the image is obscured by the metallic
   blur of a knife. This is part of the cover of "Vespertine" by Margaret
   Rogerson. Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson is a young adult dark fantasy
   novel

   Examples of Dark Fantasy

   So, what dark fantasy books have I read and liked? Gideon the Ninth has
   a science fiction vibe and is about necromancers and their cavaliers
   (badass protectors) who have to solve a mystery in a decaying pocket
   world. The black humor and unique voice of the main character make this
   a standout book. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, even if the
   blood, guts, and blobs of fat grossed me out.

   Vespertine is a young adult dark fantasy about Artemisia, a socially
   awkward teen with a traumatic past who has to defend her convent
   against the dead by wielding a relic possessed by a malevolent spirit.
   The setting is gritty, gray, and populated by corpses, but I enjoyed
   the character interactions, humorous breaks, and the snarky tone of the
   malevolent spirit.

   The Witcher is probably one of the most well-known dark fantasy series
   out there, with monster hunting, moral ambiguity, violence, corruption,
   and a grim yet likable antihero. Although I liked the stories, they do
   have explicit sexual content, which was a detractor for me.

9. Paranormal Fantasy

   Vampires, werewolves, warlocks, shadowhunters, demons, ghosts, and
   angels… It’s paranormal fantasy, popularized by the Twilight series
   (which, don’t shoot me, I haven’t read.) Paranormal fantasy is a subset
   of Urban fantasy, so they take place on our world, but are shot through
   with the supernatural.

   Here you might strike up an uneasy alliance with a vampire named
   Moriarty, learn to draw powerful runes in the fight against demons,
   speak with ghosts, and traverse energy lines in search of Welsh kings.

   Examples of Paranormal Fantasy

   Despite not reading Twilight, I have read and liked The Mortal
   Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. Demon hunters in modern-day New
   York City, anyone?
   A woman holds a cell phone with a book cover on the screen. It shows a
   young man with runes pained on his arms surrounded by mythical lights.
   "City of Bones" by Cassandra Clare is a paranormal fantasy set in New
   York City. “What do you want?”
   “Just coffee. Black – like my soul.”
   ― Cassandra Clare, City of Bones
--
10. Romantasy

   All the rage these days, romantasy is a mashup of the romance and
   fantasy genres. The term is new, but fantasy romance books have been
   around a long time. So what exactly is romantasy? Well, as with lots of
   things in the literary world, definitions are subjective.

--

   Although sword and sorcery can take place in invented worlds, it
   focuses on the personal goals of one or two characters rather than the
   world-sweeping stakes and huge casts of characters of epic fantasy. The
   plots are straightforward, the technology is medieval as a rule, and
   the sorcery is usually nefarious.
   A thin albino figure leans against a tree, wielding a black sword, red
   eyes fierce. "Elric of Melniboné" by Michael Moorcock is a classic
   sword and sworcery, one of the subgenres of fantasy.

   Examples of Sword and Sorcery

--

   Books I’ve read in this subgenre include Elric of Melniboné by Michael
   Moorcock (one of the influential authors of sword and sorcery) and some
   of The Witcher books, which are also listed under dark fantasy.
   Granted, I didn’t love Elric of Melniboné, but that’s because the main
   character made choices that were so dumb I will happily rant about them
   for ten to twenty minutes.

12. Cozy Fantasy

   Have you noticed that certain subgenres are all about settings, others
   are about scope, and others are about plot devices or the presence of
--
   a book, and a plate of Welsh Griddle cakes while fog drifts past the
   windows. Some Christmas lights wouldn’t hurt.

   Cozy fantasy books embody the cozy vibe. They promise a certain kind of
   emotion: warmth, comfort, nothing too taxing, and are ultimately
   relational. The amount of conflict in a cozy can vary, but these books
   strive to maintain equilibrium between slice-of-life scenes and
   conflict.
   A book open on blankets and surrounded by fairy lights. This is an
   example of cozy fantasy.

   If you’re the kind of person who avoids books because you don’t want to
   stay up all night reading (a valid fear), cozy fantasy could be perfect
   for you. In my limited experience, they are easy to pick up, not too
   hard to put down, and sort of… peaceful.

   Examples of Cozy Fantasy

   I’ve barely dipped my toes into cozy fantasy, though I’m not opposed to
   reading more. The only book I’ve read so far that I’m sure lands in
   this subgenre has been C.J. Klune’s House on the Cerulean Sea.

--
   Sanderson’s Tress of the Emerald Sea, a whimsical tale of a girl who
   goes on a sea voyage to rescue her friend from an evil sorceress.

13. Mythic Fantasy

   Here be fairies, creatures you’ve only heard about around the campfire
   at night or from the strange old crone with an unusual herb garden and
   eyes that have seen more than you can ever know.

   Magic and myth mingle in mythic fantasy. Here you’ll encounter worlds
   populated by Greek and Roman gods, retellings of Norse myths, and
   series inspired by Slavic fairy tales.

   Books in this subgenre draw from the legends, folklore, and deities of
   cultures around the world, from the Aztecs to the Chinese to the Irish,
   and everything in between. Mythic fantasy offers fresh takes on
   familiar stories, as well as fascinating introductions to different
   worldviews and belief systems you may not have encountered before.
   An unearthly girl with while pale hair plays a bagpipe chanter. Part of
   the image is obscured by a spray of bright green fern. This is an
   example of the mythic fantasy subgenre. “Iron made her shiver, made her
   teeth ache and hurt her if she touched it.”
   The Moorchild by Eloise McGraw

   Examples of Mythic Fantasy

   One famous example of mythic fantasy is the Percy Jackson and the
   Olympians series. They are quite fun.

   Books I’ve loved in this subgenre include The Moorchild by Eloise
--
   probably fits in this genre as well, since Baba Yaga is the villain and
   there are several nods to Alexander the Great.

14. Historical Fantasy

   If you’ve ever wished you could go back in time and change a historical
   event, you might love historical fantasy.

   As you can guess, historical fantasy, much like historical fiction, is
   set during a particular historical period, and can involve real people,
   places, or events, but aside from that, pretty much anything goes.
   Magic, dragons, werewolves, battalions of sorcerers.
   A blue book with a white crackled mask and glints of fire sits on a
   blue couch. The title reads "Fawkes" by Nadine Brandes, an excellent
   example of a historical fantasy. Color magic and the Guy Fawke’s
   Gunpowder Plot meet in this young adult novel

   Examples of Historical Fiction

   There are different approaches to historical fantasy, which writer E.S.
   Foster explains as follows:

   1. Those that take place during a specific period in history, like
--
   reasons.

   3. Lastly, they can include stories that interact with the historical
   world and a fantasy world, but separately (like C.S. Lewis’ portal
   fantasy where the Pevensie children leave WWII England and travel to
   Narnia).

   If you enjoy viking stories with a strong focus on romance, you might
   enjoy Sky in the Deep by Adrienne Young.

15. Fairy Tale Fantasy

   Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named
   Cinderella. Unfortunately, her mother had passed away, leaving her
   alone with her selfish stepmother and stepsisters… cue the singing
   mice, fairy godmother, pumpkins, and glass slippers.

   Fairy tale fantasy includes classic fairy tales like Cinderella but
   also encompasses a whole realm of spinoffs, offshoots, and retellings.
   While mythic fantasy tends toward grandeur, I think of fairy tale
   fantasy as more grounded and whimsical, though they don’t necessarily
   have to be. Most of Grimm’s fairy tales are… well, grim.

   I enjoy the light reads and twists on familiar tales afforded by this
   subgenre.
   A hand holds a book in front of a branch of wood. The cover shows a
   black-haired girl with Mongolian features clutches a notebook. This is
   "Book of a Thousand Days" by Shannon Hale, a fairy-tale fantasy.

   Examples of Fairy Tale Fantasy

   For light fun reads that are very “fairy tale-esque”, check out Gail
   Carson Levine’s fairy-tale rewrites, including Ella Enchanted and
--
   secondary world inspired by Mongolia. How cool is that? I’ve read it
   many times, and it never gets old.

   Naomi Novik’s Spinning Silver is another fairy-tale fantasy worth
   checking out.

16. Nautical Fantasy

   Salty breezes, sinewy sea beasts, enchanted islands, pirates, and
   scrambling in the rigging—find it in nautical fantasy. If you’ve ever
   dreamed of sailing the high seas, felt the allure of the ocean, or
   wanted to dive for treasure, you’ll love this subgenre.

   I love nautical fantasy and need to find more books that take place at
   sea. The ocean is a world of its own, after all, full of dangers and
   the potential for high stakes conflict. Perhaps it has some cross-over
   with political fiction, too, since a ship at sea is a kingdom unto
   itself.

   Examples of Nautical Fantasy

   Here are a few of my favorites: The Liveship Traders series is a
   fantastic adult epic fantasy series about sentient ships, pirates,
   magic, and mystical islands.

   Although the first book in Sherwood Smith’s Inda series takes place on
--
   found them so engrossing that it was hard to sleep… so maybe read them
   when you’re on vacation.
   Three books in a row showing mythical ships. This is The Liveship
   Traders trilogy, excellent adult fantasy books about sentient ships and
   their human crew.

   For a less epic and more personal story, Brandon Sanderson’s standalone
--
   especially the more Caribbean vibe. Parts of the plot didn’t land for
   me, but it’s worth checking out if you enjoy young adult books.

17. Academy Fantasy/Dark Academia

   As you can guess by the name, academy fantasies take place in schools
   or academies.
--

   We’ve all been students, harped about homework, had teachers we didn’t
   get on with (and others we did), and had to muddle through exams.
   Academy fantasy takes the familiar world of academics and transports
   it, making it more awful or more fun, or at least more fantastical.

   For people still in the throes of studenthood, there is a resonance
   among the pages. For the rest of us, there’s recognition, the spark of
   old memories, maybe a modicum of nostalgia.

   Examples of Academy Fantasy

   I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the Harry Potter series here,
   which is the most famous example. (I reread these shortly before
--
   (Here be monsters)

   The Princess Academy by Shannon Hale is a light, fairytale-esque
   academy fantasy.

   Dark Academia is the gothic cousin of academy fantasy. I haven’t read
   many books in this subgenre, unless Magicians by Lev Grossman and The
   Atlas Six by Olivie Blake count. I didn’t care much for either, mostly
   because I didn’t like the characters, but I’m not opposed to trying
   other books of a similar flavor.

18. Roguish Fantasy

   Spies, thieves, pirates, assassins, and con artists let us live
   alternate lives, and you can find them all in roguish fantasy.

   These characters have often lived tough lives, been forced into morally
   compromised choices, or simply enjoy playing fast and loose with the
--
   outskirts, the world is against them, and maybe they are waging solo
   wars in the only ways they can.

   Examples of Roguish Fantasy

   If you love heist stories, check out the Riyria Revelations series by
   Michael J. Sullivan. They are my favorite books in this subgenre. Six
--
   well.
   Two cloaked figures with swords appear on the screen of a phone above
   the title "Theft of Swords." This is a fantastic heist novel in the
   roguish fantasy subgenre. Join two thieves in an edge-of-your-seat
   heist novel

   The Lies of Locke Lamora is a roguish fantasy revenge story about con
   men and thieves. (I’m not a big fan of revenge stories, but it was well
   done.)

--
   series by Sarah J. Maas, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, and An Ember in
   the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir.

19. Comic Fantasy

   We all need more laughter in our lives, and what better way to add a
   dose of endorphins than through comic fantasy? This subgenre
   encompasses the comedic, the light-hearted, the downright ridiculous,
   and the satirical.

--
   hints of the absurd, hilarious quips, and characters who bring tears of
   laughter to my eyes.

   Examples of Comic Fantasy

   Let’s all take our hats off to Sir Terry Pratchett. His Discworld
   novels are a universe unto themselves. I won’t go into which ones to
--
   his so far.
   Several exagerrated figures wearing sunglasses and enormous swords race
   across the screen of a phone, showing the cover of Alcatraz versus the
   Evil Librarians by Brandon Sanderson, a hilarious comic fantasy for
   middle-grade readers (pre-teen). “If you don’t believe what I’m telling
   you, then ask yourself this: would any decent, kind-hearted individual
   become a writer? Of course not.”
--
20. Medieval

   Knights, castles, swords, feudal systems, quests, serfs, bards, and
   overlords—find all these and more in medieval fantasy.

   If you’ve ever dreamed of snarfing down hunks of black bread, oiling
   your chain mail, jousting, or pilfering a lord’s pockets, the world of
   medieval fantasy has all this and more. There may be evil nights,
   dragons, magic swords, and dark lords.

   These books are set in the Middle Ages, or in worlds that resemble the
--
   technology.
   A woman in a black dress lifts a sword dramatically. This is the cover
   of "The Beauty of Darkness" the final book in "The Remnant Chronicles"
   by Mary E. Pearson. This is as example of medieval fantasy.

   Examples of Medieval Fantasy

   Lots of high fantasy books are Medieval, including The Lord of the
   Rings series, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain, and the more
   recent The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

--
21. Gaslamp

   Are you craving the delicate manners and horse-drawn carriages of the
   Victorian era, plus or minus hoop skirts? Enter Gaslamp fantasy.

   This subgenre is all about Victorian-era vibes complete with historical
   settings, man servants, and strict standards of etiquette. These books
--
   magic.
   A woman holds a phone with a black book cover dotted with white crows
   above a stylized city of London. The text reads "The Angel of the
   Crows," a gaslamp fantasy by Katherine Addison.

   Examples of Gaslamp Fantasy

   Some gaslamp fantasy novels I’ve read and enjoyed include The Infernal
   Devices series by Cassandra Clare (demon hunters in 1870s London), The
   Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison (paranormal Sherlock Holmes),
   and The Invisible Library series by Genevieve Cogman (dragons and
--
   times I think it’d be fun to enter a world of clockwork machines,
   airships, and pneumatic tubes.

   Much like Gaslamp, steampunk fantasy is also inspired by Victorian-era
   settings, but the feel is less gothic and supernatural and more
   whimsical, adventurous, or dystopian. The technology in steampunk
   worlds can include airships, clockwork creatures or devices, steam
   technology, pneumatic tubes, goggles, and of course, some fantastical
   elements.

   Examples of Steampunk Fantasy

   I haven’t read a ton in this genre, but a series I enjoyed is Kenneth
   Oppel’s Airborn saga. It’s set in an alternate past with airships
   instead of airplanes. Protagonists Matt and Kate enjoy an airborne
   adventure that involves discovering fantasy creatures, combating
   pirates, and hunting for treasure.
   A cast iron teapot, an adjustable wrench, and black screws are arranged
   on concrete around a phone with the cover of book on the screen. It
   shows an airship and the title "Airborne" by Kenneth Oppel, a steampunk
   fantasy for middle grade readers. “Never climb a tree in a long dress,”
   Kate panted, coming up behind me.
   “I’ll remember that,” I said.”
   ― Kenneth Oppel, Airborn

23. Grimdark Fantasy

   Grimdark = Grim/powerless characters and dark worlds. One person cannot
   make a significant difference.

   Before we end… let’s chat about some additional subgenres you might
   encounter. These embody a certain ideal, and often, that ideal or
   worldview is written into the fabric of the fantasy world itself. They
   ask philosophical questions: Is the world ultimately dark or bright?
   Are we capable of effecting heroic change, or any change at all?

--

   Not so much to me, but it’s a popular subgenre.

   Examples of Grimdark Fantasy

   Although I haven’t read them, George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and
   Fire is on all the Grimdark book lists I encountered while researching
--
   virtuous heroes prevail. Love, hope, and redemption win out through
   noble sacrifices.

   Examples of Noblebright Fantasy

   This term was coined by author C.J. Brightly, so if you’re interested
   in this subgenre, exploring her books is probably a good place to
   start. (I haven’t read her yet myself.)

   Much classic fantasy is considered noblebright, including The
   Chronicles of Narnia, The Chronicles of Prydain, and The Lord of the
   Rings.
   The distant figures of the Fellowship of the Ring make their way
--
   embraces hope. But maybe it’s just an edgier version of noblebright?
   Join my Facebook group and tell me what you think!

   Examples of Hopepunk Fantasy

   As I mentioned in my intro, I found one of my favorite books thanks to
   the term “hopepunk,” so it’ll always hold a soft spot in my heart. That
--
   That, my friends, is the power of subgenres. And subgenre lists. And if
   you want to go even further, you can search for tropes as well.
   Yvonne with one of her favorite books, "The Goblin Emperor" by
   Katherine Addison. It is considered hopepunk fantasy by some. Me, with
   my obsessive re-read

Subgenres vs Tropes

   If we think of subgenres as sub-categories of fantasy with particular
   flavor profiles, (like Italian, Caribbean, or Chinese are
   sub-categories in the realm of cuisine), we can think of tropes as the
   common ingredients that we find across a wide range of novels.

   For example, the protagonists in many fantasy and young adult books are
   orphans. Because this story element is common across lots of books in
   the genre, it is considered a trope. And if it’s a trope you like, you
   can search for books with that particular story element (such as the
   dead parents trope common in young adult fantasy). Or, if you are
   up-to-your-ears in orphan books, you might prefer a book that doesn’t
   include that ingredient.

--

   I’m a big fan of the “found family” trope, so when I’m perusing book
   lists or asking for recommendations, I might say something like, “I
   would love to read a nautical adventure fantasy with found family and a
   forced proximity romance subplot.” And somebody might be able to
   recommend one to me.

   Cool, right?

   Check out my post on fantasy book tropes to learn to find books with
   ingredients you like.

FAQs

What genre is fantasy in the real world?

   Fantasy novels set in the real world are low fantasy. These stories
   take place in the real world, where magic is and other fantastical
   elements exist, but are often hidden. Additional subgenres in the real
   world include historical, gaslamp, steampunk, urban, and paranormal.

Made It This Far? Here’s a Quick Win

   The subgenres of fantasy can be hard to define with exactness,
   especially as new ones emerge, fuse, and spark variations. But don’t
   stress about it. In the end, they’re nothing more than search terms to
   help us describe our reading preferences so we can find the books we
   like, recommend books to others, and discover new flavors of fantasy
   we’d like to try.

   Being able to say, “This book is a political steampunk-inspired high
   fantasy with personal stakes,” only matters if saying that inspires you
   to read it (or prevents you from reading it because you know you’d hate
   it).

   An intro to some of my favorite subgenres:

   This list of five young adult fantasy series includes political
   fantasy, academy fantasy, mythic fantasy, epic dystopian high fantasy,
   and a western-inspired high fantasy adventure series:

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

--
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
--
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

--
   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
--
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
--
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
--
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
--
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.

   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
--
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
--
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
--
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

--
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
--
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

--
   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
--
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
--
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
--
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
--
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.

   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
--
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
--
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
--
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

    Location   Theater an der Wien, Vienna
   Performers  Ludwig van Beethoven (piano)

   The Fantasy for piano, vocal soloists, mixed chorus, and orchestra,
   Op. 80, usually called the Choral Fantasy, was composed in 1808 by then
   38-year-old Ludwig van Beethoven.

   Beethoven intended the Fantasy to serve as the concluding work for the
   benefit concert he put on for himself on 22 December 1808; the
   performers consisted of vocal soloists, mixed chorus, an orchestra, and
   Beethoven himself as piano soloist. The Fantasy was designed to include
   all the participants in the program and thus unites all of these
   musical forces.

   moments, the chords (in C major) C–F–D–(G)–E♭, where the E♭ stands out
   from its harmonic context and is performed fortissimo. The words sung
   at this point are (for the Choral Fantasy) "Lieb und Kraft" ("love and
   strength") and (for the Ninth Symphony) "Über'm Sternenzelt! Über
   Sternen muss er wohnen." ("Above the tent of the stars, above the stars

   Fantasy music is a genre that often incorporates elements of folk,

Music and Fantasy in Perfect Harmony

   By William Blanc

   In films or novels, music accompanies fantasy everywhere. Many
   composers, in turn, have immersed themselves in the genre, from film
   music to rock, rap and metal.

--
   wandering minstrel, as the "Troubadour Style" spread to painting in
   19th-century France. We also find ballad in the noun "baladine", a
   traveller whom the reader accompanies to a faraway, imaginary and
   enchanted universe. So it is not surprising that fantasy, heir
   to English medievalism, is a genre imbued with music.

   <i>The Minstrel</i>, drawing by François Grenier and Jules Davod,
--
   and Songs of Middle Earth, in which we hear not only Tolkien reciting
   some of his verses, but also interpretations of his songs by an opera
   singer, William Elvin. This record was one of the first examples of
   multimedia fantasy creation, where, in response to demand by curious
   fans, sound and visual elements are added to a literary fantasy world
   (illustrations, notably through calendars), a process that naturally
   leads to the staging of film or television versions.

--

Progressive Rock and Counterculture

   As a genre full of references to music, fantasy would quickly influence
   composers, particularly those of the protest generation of the 1960s,
   who saw in Tolkien's works, and more broadly in magical medievalism, an
   instrument for criticizing the contemporary industrial and military
--
   Took (1970) Get Back Records, 2003

   But it was progressive rock musicians who would draw their inspiration
   from fantasy the most. This musical genre is constructed like a
   psychedelic journey far from contemporary reality, a "trip" often
   triggered by the use of hallucinogenic drugs. It is thus made up of
   long pieces evoking imaginary worlds. The title of leading progressive
   rock band Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
   (1967), was a direct reference to Kenneth Grahame's youth fantasy novel
   The Wind in the Willows (1908). The characters in the story,
   anthropomorphic animals, see the god Pan playing a piece on his flute
   at dawn. This scene, a favorite of Sid Barrett, singer of Pink Floyd

   The popularity of magical themes in progressive rock would later
   inspire metal musicians and songwriters, who like fantasy writers,
   plunge their audience into a medieval fantasy world.

   Music

--

Symphony and Epic Music

   At the same time, fantasy quickly began producing original tracks,
   especially for feature films and associated video games. Many of these
   works resembled compositions for opera, especially those by Richard
   Wagner, which are still a reference today, or for symphony orchestras,
--
   classical orchestra, and toured the world several times to celebrate
   the game's 25th anniversary. This phenomenon shows both the fascination
   of an audience of adult fans for the adventurous and imaginary ballads
   of their childhood, but also the increasing acceptance of fantasy in
   society. Thereafter, these productions were performed in symphony halls
   that are more associated with a legitimate, bourgeois and learned
   culture.

   The popularity of fantasy at the beginning of the 21st century
   continued to influence artists in popular musical genres, especially in
   those who until then had taken little inspiration from medieval magic.
   This imaginary world referred to a theme that was too "Europe-centered"
--
   hip-hop artists and rappers, such as the Wu-Tang Clan with their album
   Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) released in 1993, or the French artist
   Shurik'N with his song "Samurai" (1998). This music quickly became
   imbued with fantasy and albums, such as L'École du micro d'argent
   (1997) by the French group IAM, made direct reference to the genre.
   Shortly after the release of the Game of Thrones series, this
   fascination led to the publication on the Internet of two mixtapes
--
   a song composed by Sofiane, a rapper from Stains in Seine-Saint-Denis.
   Accompanying the French release of Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of
   the Sword (2017) (a version of the Camelot myth strongly marked by
   fantasy), the song begins as follows: "Lift up the street, as you would
   lift up the Grail".

Music and Fantasy in Perfect Harmony

   By William Blanc

   In films or novels, music accompanies fantasy everywhere. Many
   composers, in turn, have immersed themselves in the genre, from film
   music to rock, rap and metal.

--
   wandering minstrel, as the "Troubadour Style" spread to painting in
   19th-century France. We also find ballad in the noun "baladine", a
   traveller whom the reader accompanies to a faraway, imaginary and
   enchanted universe. So it is not surprising that fantasy, heir
   to English medievalism, is a genre imbued with music.

   <i>The Minstrel</i>, drawing by François Grenier and Jules Davod,
--
   and Songs of Middle Earth, in which we hear not only Tolkien reciting
   some of his verses, but also interpretations of his songs by an opera
   singer, William Elvin. This record was one of the first examples of
   multimedia fantasy creation, where, in response to demand by curious
   fans, sound and visual elements are added to a literary fantasy world
   (illustrations, notably through calendars), a process that naturally
   leads to the staging of film or television versions.

--

Progressive Rock and Counterculture

   As a genre full of references to music, fantasy would quickly influence
   composers, particularly those of the protest generation of the 1960s,
   who saw in Tolkien's works, and more broadly in magical medievalism, an
   instrument for criticizing the contemporary industrial and military
--
   Took (1970) Get Back Records, 2003

   But it was progressive rock musicians who would draw their inspiration
   from fantasy the most. This musical genre is constructed like a
   psychedelic journey far from contemporary reality, a "trip" often
   triggered by the use of hallucinogenic drugs. It is thus made up of
   long pieces evoking imaginary worlds. The title of leading progressive
   rock band Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
   (1967), was a direct reference to Kenneth Grahame's youth fantasy novel
   The Wind in the Willows (1908). The characters in the story,
   anthropomorphic animals, see the god Pan playing a piece on his flute
   at dawn. This scene, a favorite of Sid Barrett, singer of Pink Floyd
--

   The popularity of magical themes in progressive rock would later
   inspire metal musicians and songwriters, who like fantasy writers,
   plunge their audience into a medieval fantasy world.

   Music

--

Symphony and Epic Music

   At the same time, fantasy quickly began producing original tracks,
   especially for feature films and associated video games. Many of these
   works resembled compositions for opera, especially those by Richard
   Wagner, which are still a reference today, or for symphony orchestras,
--
   classical orchestra, and toured the world several times to celebrate
   the game's 25th anniversary. This phenomenon shows both the fascination
   of an audience of adult fans for the adventurous and imaginary ballads
   of their childhood, but also the increasing acceptance of fantasy in
   society. Thereafter, these productions were performed in symphony halls
   that are more associated with a legitimate, bourgeois and learned
   culture.

   The popularity of fantasy at the beginning of the 21st century
   continued to influence artists in popular musical genres, especially in
   those who until then had taken little inspiration from medieval magic.
   This imaginary world referred to a theme that was too "Europe-centered"
--
   hip-hop artists and rappers, such as the Wu-Tang Clan with their album
   Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) released in 1993, or the French artist
   Shurik'N with his song "Samurai" (1998). This music quickly became
   imbued with fantasy and albums, such as L'École du micro d'argent
   (1997) by the French group IAM, made direct reference to the genre.
   Shortly after the release of the Game of Thrones series, this
   fascination led to the publication on the Internet of two mixtapes
--
   a song composed by Sofiane, a rapper from Stains in Seine-Saint-Denis.
   Accompanying the French release of Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of
   the Sword (2017) (a version of the Camelot myth strongly marked by
   fantasy), the song begins as follows: "Lift up the street, as you would
   lift up the Grail".

The Depth and Wonder of Fantasy Music

   What is Fantasy Music, really? As a broad category, it describes
   musical pieces that transport the listener to an imaginary world. In
   this article, we want to present you the most amazing compositions
   we’ve discovered over the years. Of course, they were all great
   inspirations in writing our own Fantasy TV Series Black Forest Witch.

     Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? /
     Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
     Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody

   If you research the topic of Fantasy, you will discover a lot of books,
   games, movies and TV series easily. Music probably doesn’t even come to
   your mind when you think about the question what’s to be considered
   fantastical. However, there’s a tight connection between the two that
   might not be obvious at first glance: On the one hand, music plays an
   important part in the world-building, tone and atmosphere of Fantasy
   Movies and all other media that utilize moving images. In a sense, it
   supports them in creating this otherworldly feeling in the audience. On
   the other hand, music can stand entirely on its own. Music is an
--
   phenomenon in its own right.

Subcategories of Fantasy Music

   Fantasy Music relates to Fantasy Art, as they are both broad
   categories, formed from a very modern understanding of media. Both
   comprise a variety of different styles from different epochs. Here are
   some of the main categories that we think are relevant today:

   travelling back there to those strange lands and cultures. Consider
   them to be inspired by historical events and characters.

Ancient Fantasy Music

   From Mesopotamia where the first human civilizations formed to the high
   middle ages in Europe, we can recognize a lot of different cultures. Of

Celtic and Viking Music

   Celtic and Viking themes are at the heart of Fantasy Music. Both these
   cultures play a dominant role in the literary Fantasy genre: From the
   Norse Gods Odin and Thor to the story of King Arthur, the influence
   they still have is substantial. Often, they are named in the same
   breath, while being considerably different. For one, the Vikings were

Medieval Fantasy Music

   The middle ages were considered the dark times in our history. That’s
   why there’s a lot of beauty, but also a lot of darkness to Medieval
   Music. And just as Knights, Courtship and being on adventures is still
   a Fantasy today, the Medieval Fantasy Music transports us there with
   its noble and festive sounds.

Epic Fantasy Music

   Epic Fantasy Music leans heavily into gaming. The player’s own actions
   demand the support of this engaging music. Of course, this soundtrack
   for the original Assassin’s Creed is also inspired by Medieval tunes:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKnTUsQ6sb0?feature=oembed

Fantasy Metal

   Metal is very diverse. Fantasy Metal as a subcategory is closely linked
   with Fantasy Novels, as the songs further Fantasy as a narrative genre.
   The most well-known band featuring this category is probably the German
   Power Metal band Blind Guardian. Their The Bard’s Song is inspired
   heavily by the Middle Ages:
--
     Due to our magic songs.
     Blind Guardian, The Bard’s Song

Fantasy Soundtracks

   Many great Fantasy Movies have also great soundtracks. One of my
   personal favorites is from the Science-Fiction Fantasy Film Tron:
   Legacy by the French electronic band Daft Punk:

Other Fantasy Music

   It could be argued that Music in itself is a Fantasy. Consider a simple
   composition like the Tropical House song Don’t be so shy by French
   pop-soul artist Imany – doesn’t this song invite us to a gorgeous
   Fantasy vacation at the beach, one that might never come? What about
   other songs like John Lennon’s Imagine, in which he sings of a world
   without borders and prejudice?

--
   common. It’s a great quality of music that’s fun and engages us as
   listeners. And I’m sure we will discover many great new artists and
   compositons in the years to come that give us this great feeling of
   companionship and empowerment that all Fantasy does.

Best fantasy music VST?

   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   EW fantasy is mostly bombastic and "big", and not intimistic or "calm".
   For quiter mood i would rely on "rinascimento" from fluffy audio (i
   don't have it)

   ProjectSam Lumina is made for the Fantasy genre, and it is absolutely

   Looks interesting! Though i would have to get the full version of
   kontakt. I see. I'll have to take a deeper look at what kind of sound I
   want, cuz from what I've heard of Fantasy orchestra, it sounds really
   nice.

   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   A lot of the Karoryfer stuff if you like your fantasy stuff a little
   quirkier. And Insanity Samples Shire Winds is a nice one.

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the

   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been

   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the

   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been

   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5

   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

   American Psychological Association
--
Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common
   This research was supported, in part, by Research Grant HD17371
   from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
--
   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone
--
   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   retention of
   the
   material was assessed 2 weeks later.
   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach
--
   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each
   2 Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide examples of the
   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present

   two
   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.
   3 Although some common motivational benefits of fantasy involve-
   ment have been observed, differences in the specific fantasies that
   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound

   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or
--
   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   sons of the no-fantasy version with the

   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   Even when the time that students

   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-

   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,

   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,

   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,

   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated

   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-

   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning

   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an

   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student

   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more

   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   Even when the time that students

   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context

   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-

   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,

   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,

   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,

   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-

   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it

   important to

   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Children's Learning and Motivation: Making
Learning More Fun

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone

   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
--
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
--
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-

   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach

   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each

   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-

   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning

   have been designed to be congruent with one another.

   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an

   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student

   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would

   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more

   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of

   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.

   Even when the time that students

   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.

   ity and appeal. Had the range of options included fantasies that
   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.

   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-

   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,

   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by

   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,

   Chabay

   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-

   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
--
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
--
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

The Boundaries of Fantasy

   If you look at all the different things that are called fantasy — and I
   mean just in the context of fantasy literature, not sexual fantasies
   etc. — you start to wonder if there is anything that they all have in
   common or whether, in Wittgenstein’s words, they simply “form a
   family.” Fantasy is one of those things that gets harder to define the
   closer you look at it, like gender or — as Wittgenstein famously
   pointed out — games. In “Philosophy and Fantasy”, Laurence Gagnon gives
   us a definition which seems appealing at first sight: “any story might
   justifiably be called ‘a fantasy’ which gives us some explicit
   indication of the personality of one or more of the characters and
   which is also about a world that is conceivable but physically
   impossible.” However, there is the difficulty of saying exactly what is
   physically impossible; given what we know of physics, dragons are a far
   more likely possibility than faster-than-light travel, yet the latter
   is a staple of science fiction, not fantasy. Moreover, as Gagnon
   admits, the term “fantasy” is here used “in a very general way such
   that some writings called ‘fairy-tales’, some labeled
   ‘science-fiction’, and, perhaps, some designated ‘dream-stories’ will
   fall under the concept of fantasy.” Since Gagnon is interested in
   fantasy as a philosophical tool, that will do for him, but if we are
   interested in fantasy literature, we need something that will explain
   why The Lord of the Rings is definitely fantasy, The Day of the
   Triffids definitely isn’t and Star Wars and Twilight are on the fuzzy
   borders with SF and horror respectively. I recently saw Twilight
   described as “urban fantasy”, which is silly considering that it takes
   place in a village, but does at least note that fangs do not a horror
   film make. Twilight could fairly be described as low fantasy (i.e. a
   tale where fantastic elements are found in the normal world, as opposed
   to high fantasy, which has a world all of its own). But if that is
   true, then should we say the same of Dracula?

   It could be that the distinction between fantasy and horror is of a
   different kind than the distinction between fantasy and science
   fiction. Horror is like comedy or pornography, in that it is a genre
   defined by the feelings it is designed to arouse, whereas fantasy, like
   westerns, is defined by the kind of things it describes. That is why
   such disparate creations as The Saw and The Omen can both be called
   horror films, and why when you reduce the scare quotient in a lot of
   so-called horror, you see that it is fantasy or SF. (Of course there
   are people who are genuinely scared of the vampires in Twilight, but
   they’re just wusses.) The categories of fantasy and horror overlap, not
   because of Wittgensteinian vagueness, but because they should. If you
   have an overlap between the sets of plants and animals, you assume that
   the concepts “plant” and “animal” are a bit fuzzy, but there is nothing
   surprising about an overlap between the set of plants and the set of
   edible things.

   Coming to the more notorious overlap between fantasy and science
   fiction, we therefore need to ask which kind of overlap it is: is it a
   plant/animal or a plant/edible overlap? Both the fantasy and science
   fiction genres are defined largely in terms of what they describe, and
   both involve describing things which we are fairly sure do not exist
   and have never existed. They are also the kind of things which not only
--
   might put down his teacup and murmur “Well I never!” This is probably
   not how we would react if it were proved that Sauron was a real person.

   Both fantasy and science fiction, then, deal with things that make us
   go “wow!” They are “astounding tales,” and in this respect, the genres
   are also a little like horror, in that their definition includes the
   feelings they are designed to evoke. A novel set in a world which was
   exactly the same as ours with addition of toast that always falls with
   the buttered side up would fit Gagnon’s definition of fantasy, but
   would not be fantastic; neither would it make for interesting science
   fiction. But is the “wow” of fantasy the same as the “wow” of science
   fiction? If that were the case, fantasy would be decidedly less
   impressive, as Ryan Somma argues in a fictitious dialogue between
   “fanboy” and “scientist”: for every impressive fantasy creature, device
   or journey, science fiction has something bigger, stronger, faster or
   whatever. Shadowfax may carry Gandalf faster than any horse, but that’s
   still well below the speed of light … or even the speed of a family
   car. But this is not how it works: the “wow” of fantasy is subtly
   different from the “wow” of SF. As I said, dragons are a much more
   feasible proposition than faster than light travel, but dragons strike
   us as more magical and mysterious.
--
   something between Jurassic Park and Godzilla here.

   This would make passable, if rather unoriginal science fiction, but
   despite the presence of dragons it definitely wouldn’t be fantasy. The
   fact that the dragons’ genesis is explained identifies it as SF, but
   this is not the most important point; it is a side-effect of an
   essential feature of science fiction, which is that it follows, or at
--
   saying “This is happening in our universe, according to the laws of
   that universe.” They are most definitely not saying “Faster than light
   travel is physically impossible, but our hero can do it because he has
   a magic spaceship.” That would be fantasy. What fantasy does is not to
   bend or even flout the rules; it says “The rules here are different.”
   Not only are we not in Kansas any more, we aren’t even in hyper-Kansas.
   This may be what makes the “wow” of fantasy different from the “wow” of
   SF. When Shadowfax gallops at the speed of a Citroen, we aren’t saying
   “Wow, that’s fast!” We’re saying “Wow, a magic horse!”

   This makes sense for high fantasy, when the author has created a world
   that has different rules from ours. But what about low fantasy, where
   strange things happen in our world? I think there are two ways to look
   at this. One is that our world is basically the world as we know it,
   but beings from other worlds have entered it (low fantasy is also
   tellingly called “intrusive fantasy”). In this view, low fantasy is
   like portal fantasy — where our heroes enter another world through some
   kind of gateway, as in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe — but in
   reverse. Buffy the Vampire Slayer uses this idea, with the Hellmouth
   being a kind of portal allowing various kinds of nasties to congregate
   in an otherwise normal American town. In other types of low fantasy,
   however, the supernatural creatures are very much part of our world.
   Here the “wow” factors comes not from the idea that there are magical
   worlds, or that magical creatures can enter our world, but that our
--
   magic. We’re all kept alive by magic, Sookie. My magic’s just a little
   different from yours, that’s all.”

   If it is true that what makes fantasy is the idea of different rules,
   then that would explain why Star Wars sits so uncomfortably (but
   effectively) on the fence between fantasy and SF. It has all the
   trappings of space opera, but we are in no doubt that we are being told
   a fairy tale. When we see those words “A long time ago, in a galaxy
   far, far away …” we don’t think “Hang on, all galaxies are far away. I
   mean the nearest galaxy to us is Andromeda, and that’s 2,500,000 light
   years away.” What we think is “Once upon a time …” and what we
   understand is “The rules are different here.”

The Boundaries of Fantasy

   If you look at all the different things that are called fantasy — and I
   mean just in the context of fantasy literature, not sexual fantasies
   etc. — you start to wonder if there is anything that they all have in
   common or whether, in Wittgenstein’s words, they simply “form a
   family.” Fantasy is one of those things that gets harder to define the
   closer you look at it, like gender or — as Wittgenstein famously
   pointed out — games. In “Philosophy and Fantasy”, Laurence Gagnon gives
   us a definition which seems appealing at first sight: “any story might
   justifiably be called ‘a fantasy’ which gives us some explicit
   indication of the personality of one or more of the characters and
   which is also about a world that is conceivable but physically
   impossible.” However, there is the difficulty of saying exactly what is
   physically impossible; given what we know of physics, dragons are a far
   more likely possibility than faster-than-light travel, yet the latter
   is a staple of science fiction, not fantasy. Moreover, as Gagnon
   admits, the term “fantasy” is here used “in a very general way such
   that some writings called ‘fairy-tales’, some labeled
   ‘science-fiction’, and, perhaps, some designated ‘dream-stories’ will
   fall under the concept of fantasy.” Since Gagnon is interested in
   fantasy as a philosophical tool, that will do for him, but if we are
   interested in fantasy literature, we need something that will explain
   why The Lord of the Rings is definitely fantasy, The Day of the
   Triffids definitely isn’t and Star Wars and Twilight are on the fuzzy
   borders with SF and horror respectively. I recently saw Twilight
   described as “urban fantasy”, which is silly considering that it takes
   place in a village, but does at least note that fangs do not a horror
   film make. Twilight could fairly be described as low fantasy (i.e. a
   tale where fantastic elements are found in the normal world, as opposed
   to high fantasy, which has a world all of its own). But if that is
   true, then should we say the same of Dracula?

   It could be that the distinction between fantasy and horror is of a
   different kind than the distinction between fantasy and science
   fiction. Horror is like comedy or pornography, in that it is a genre
   defined by the feelings it is designed to arouse, whereas fantasy, like
   westerns, is defined by the kind of things it describes. That is why
   such disparate creations as The Saw and The Omen can both be called
   horror films, and why when you reduce the scare quotient in a lot of
   so-called horror, you see that it is fantasy or SF. (Of course there
   are people who are genuinely scared of the vampires in Twilight, but
   they’re just wusses.) The categories of fantasy and horror overlap, not
   because of Wittgensteinian vagueness, but because they should. If you
   have an overlap between the sets of plants and animals, you assume that
   the concepts “plant” and “animal” are a bit fuzzy, but there is nothing
   surprising about an overlap between the set of plants and the set of
   edible things.

   Coming to the more notorious overlap between fantasy and science
   fiction, we therefore need to ask which kind of overlap it is: is it a
   plant/animal or a plant/edible overlap? Both the fantasy and science
   fiction genres are defined largely in terms of what they describe, and
   both involve describing things which we are fairly sure do not exist
   and have never existed. They are also the kind of things which not only
--
   might put down his teacup and murmur “Well I never!” This is probably
   not how we would react if it were proved that Sauron was a real person.

   Both fantasy and science fiction, then, deal with things that make us
   go “wow!” They are “astounding tales,” and in this respect, the genres
   are also a little like horror, in that their definition includes the
   feelings they are designed to evoke. A novel set in a world which was
   exactly the same as ours with addition of toast that always falls with
   the buttered side up would fit Gagnon’s definition of fantasy, but
   would not be fantastic; neither would it make for interesting science
   fiction. But is the “wow” of fantasy the same as the “wow” of science
   fiction? If that were the case, fantasy would be decidedly less
   impressive, as Ryan Somma argues in a fictitious dialogue between
   “fanboy” and “scientist”: for every impressive fantasy creature, device
   or journey, science fiction has something bigger, stronger, faster or
   whatever. Shadowfax may carry Gandalf faster than any horse, but that’s
   still well below the speed of light … or even the speed of a family
   car. But this is not how it works: the “wow” of fantasy is subtly
   different from the “wow” of SF. As I said, dragons are a much more
   feasible proposition than faster than light travel, but dragons strike
   us as more magical and mysterious.
--
   something between Jurassic Park and Godzilla here.

   This would make passable, if rather unoriginal science fiction, but
   despite the presence of dragons it definitely wouldn’t be fantasy. The
   fact that the dragons’ genesis is explained identifies it as SF, but
   this is not the most important point; it is a side-effect of an
   essential feature of science fiction, which is that it follows, or at
--
   saying “This is happening in our universe, according to the laws of
   that universe.” They are most definitely not saying “Faster than light
   travel is physically impossible, but our hero can do it because he has
   a magic spaceship.” That would be fantasy. What fantasy does is not to
   bend or even flout the rules; it says “The rules here are different.”
   Not only are we not in Kansas any more, we aren’t even in hyper-Kansas.
   This may be what makes the “wow” of fantasy different from the “wow” of
   SF. When Shadowfax gallops at the speed of a Citroen, we aren’t saying

The Effect of Fantasy Context on Moral Action and Judgment

   choice between behaving morally and behaving immorally to advance their
   goals. In Study 3, an MTurk sample judged the actions of a character
   who behaved immorally. For Study 1, a gender by condition interaction
   was found, with males electing more immoral actions in the fantasy
   condition. For Study 2, no such effect was found. Nonetheless, in Study
   3, participants judged immoral actions in the realistic condition as
   more immoral compared to the fantasy context. Across all studies,
   transportation predicted choosing fewer immoral actions and judging
   immoral actions more harshly.

   Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction that involves supernatural or
   magical elements, often including completely imaginary realms and
   creatures.^[1]^[2]

   The genre's roots lie in fantasy literature and drama. From the
   twentieth century onward, it has expanded into various media, including
   film, television, graphic novels, manga, animation, and video games.

   Anglophone literary critics.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] An archaic spelling for
   the term is phantasy.^[7]

   Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction
   and horror by an absence of scientific or macabre themes, although
   these can occur in fantasy. In popular culture, the fantasy genre
   predominantly features settings that reflect the actual Earth, but with
   some sense of otherness.^[8]

   Show (骷髏幻戲圖) by Li Song (1190–1264)

   Many works of fantasy use magic or other supernatural elements as a
   main plot element, theme, or setting.^[9] Magic, magic practitioners
   (sorcerers, witches and so on) and magical creatures are common in many
   of these worlds.^[7]

   An identifying trait of fantasy is the author's use of narrative
   elements that do not have to rely on history or nature to be
   coherent.^[10] This differs from realistic fiction in that realistic
   fiction has to attend to the history and natural laws of reality, where
   fantasy does not. In writing fantasy the author uses worldbuilding to
   create characters, situations, and settings that may not be possible in
   reality.

   Many fantasy authors use real-world folklore and mythology as
   inspiration;^[11] and although another defining characteristic of the
   fantasy genre is the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as
   magic,^[12] this does not have to be the case.

   Fantasy has often been compared to science fiction and horror because
   they are the major categories of speculative fiction. Fantasy is
   distinguished from science fiction by the plausibility of the narrative
   elements. A science fiction narrative is unlikely, though seemingly
   possible through logical scientific or technological extrapolation,
   where fantasy narratives do not need to be scientifically
   possible.^[10] Authors have to rely on the readers' suspension of
   disbelief, an acceptance of the unbelievable or impossible for the sake
   of enjoyment, in order to write effective fantasies. Despite both
   genres' heavy reliance on the supernatural, fantasy and horror are
   distinguishable from one another. Horror primarily evokes fear through
   the protagonists' weaknesses or inability to deal with the
   antagonists.^[13]

   While elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were part of
   literature from its beginning, fantasy elements also occur throughout
   ancient religious texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh.^[14] The ancient
   Babylonian creation epic, the Enûma Eliš, in which the god Marduk slays
   the goddess Tiamat,^[15] reflects the theme of cosmic conflict between
   good and evil, which is characteristic of the modern fantasy
   genre.^[15] Genres of romantic and fantasy literature also existed in
   ancient Egypt.^[16] The Tales of the Court of King Khufu, which is
   preserved in the Westcar Papyrus and was probably written in the middle
   of the second half of the eighteenth century BC, preserves a mixture of
   stories with elements of historical fiction, fantasy, and
   satire.^[17]^[18] Egyptian funerary texts preserve mythological
   tales,^[16] the most significant of which are the myths of Osiris and
   his son Horus.^[16]
--
   which an Athenian man persuades the world's birds to build a city in
   the clouds and thereby challenges Zeus's authority.^[20] Ovid's
   Metamorphoses and Apuleius's The Golden Ass are both works that
   influenced the development of the fantasy genre^[20] by taking mythic
   elements and weaving them into personal accounts.^[20] Both works
   involve complex narratives in which humans beings are transformed into
   animals or inanimate objects.^[20] Platonic teachings and early
   Christian theology are major influences on the modern fantasy
   genre.^[20] Plato used allegories to convey many of his teachings,^[20]
   and early Christian writers interpreted both the Old and New Testaments
   as employing parables to convey spiritual truths.^[20] This ability to
   find meaning in a story that is not literally true became the
   foundation for developing the modern fantasy genre.^[20]

   Islamic, Hindu, and Chinese sources contain fantasy elements as well.
   The best-known fiction from the Islamic world is One Thousand and One
   Nights (The Arabian Nights), which is a compilation of ancient and
   medieval folk tales. Various characters from this epic have become
--
   particularly in the Indian epics. The Panchatantra (Fables of Bidpai),
   for example, used animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the
   central Indian principles of political science. Chinese traditions have
   been particularly influential in the vein of fantasy known as
   Chinoiserie, which includes such writers as Ernest Bramah and Barry
   Hughart.^[21]

   Beowulf is among the best known of the Old English tales in the
   English-speaking world, and it has deeply influenced the fantasy genre;
   several fantasy works have retold the story, for example, John
   Gardner's novel Grendel.^[22] Norse mythology, as found in the Elder
   Edda and Younger Edda collections, includes such figures as the god
   Odin and his fellow Aesir, in addition to dwarves, elves, dragons, and
   giants.^[23] These elements have been directly imported into various
   fantasy works. The distinct folklores of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland
   have sometimes been used indiscriminately for "Celtic" fantasy,
   sometimes with great success; other writers have specified the use of a
   single source.^[24] The Welsh tradition has been particularly
   influential, because of its connection to the legendary King Arthur and
   its collection into a single work, the epic Mabinogion.^[24]

   There are many works where the boundary between fantasy and other
   genres is unclear: did the writers believe in the possibility of the
   marvels in the play A Midsummer Night's Dream or the romance in Sir
   Gawain and the Green Knight? This question makes it difficult to
   distinguish when fantasy began, in its modern sense.^[25]

Modern fantasy

   [edit]

   and the Goblin

   Although pre-dated by John Ruskin's story The King of the Golden River
   (1841), the history of modern fantasy literature is usually said to
   begin with George MacDonald, the Scottish author of such novels as
   Phantastes (1858) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872); the former is
   widely considered to be the first fantasy novel ever written for
   adults. MacDonald was a major influence on both J. R. R. Tolkien and C.
   S. Lewis.^[26] The other major fantasy author of this era was William
   Morris, an English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of
   the century, including The Wood Beyond the World (1894) and The Well at
   the World's End (1896).
--
   Despite MacDonald's future influence with the novel At the Back of the
   North Wind (1871), Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, and H.
   G. Wells's novel The Wonderful Visit (1895), it was not until the 20th
   century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. Lord
   Dunsany established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the
   short story forms. H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, and Edgar Rice
   Burroughs began to write fantasy around this time. These authors, along
   with Abraham Merritt, established what was known as the lost world
   subgenre; this was the most popular form of fantasy in the early
   decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's
   fantasies, such as Peter Pan and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, were also
   published around this time.

   Juvenile fantasy was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended
   for adults, with the consequence that writers who wished to write
   fantasy for adults needed to fit their work into forms aimed at
   children.^[27] Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote fantasy in A Wonder-Book for
   Girls and Boys, intended for children,^[28] although his works for
   adults only verged on fantasy. For many years, this book and successes
   such as the novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) created a
   circular effect: all fantasy works, even the later series The Lord of
   the Rings, were therefore classified as children's
   literature.^[citation needed]

   Political and social trends can affect a society's reception of
   fantasy. In the early 20th century, the New Culture Movement's
   enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to
   condemn the fantastical shenmo genre of traditional Chinese literature.
   The spells and magical creatures in these novels were viewed as
   superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the
   modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be
   denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China
   experienced a revival in fantasy only after the Cultural Revolution had
   ended.^[29]

   Fantasy became a genre of pulp magazines published in the West. The
   first all-fantasy fiction magazine, Weird Tales, was published in 1923.
   Many similar magazines eventually followed, including The Magazine of
   Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF). When this magazine was founded in
   1949, the pulp format was at the height of its popularity; F&SF was
   instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the
   US and the UK. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of
   science fiction, and the two genres were first associated with each
   other around this time.
--
   By 1950, sword and sorcery fiction had begun to find a wider audience,
   with the success of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories and
   Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories.^[30] However, it was
   the advent of high fantasy—especially J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The
   Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, which reached new heights of
   popularity in the late 1960s—that allowed fantasy to enter the
   mainstream.^[31] Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's The
   Chronicles of Narnia and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea, helped to cement
   the genre's popularity.

   The popularity of the fantasy genre has continued to increase in the
   21st century, as evidenced by the best-selling status of several
   series: J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of
   Time, George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, Steven Erikson's

   Fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) span several media. Dungeons &
   Dragons (D&D) was the first tabletop role-playing game, and it remains
   the most successful and influential. According to a 1999 survey in the
   United States, six percent of 12- to 35-year-olds have played

   icon of the role-playing video game genre. (As of 2012^[update], it was
   still among the top ten best-selling video game franchises.) The first
   collectible card game, Magic: The Gathering, has a fantasy theme and is
   similarly dominant in the industry.^[34]

   [edit]

   In her book Rhetorics of Fantasy (2008),^[36] Farah Mendlesohn proposes
   a taxonomy of fantasy, as "determined by the means by which the
   fantastic enters the narrated world."^[37] (She notes some fantasies
   fit none of the patterns in this taxonomy.) The taxonomy categories are
   as follows:

   Portal fantasy
          In portal-quest fantasy or portal fantasy, a fantasy world is
          entered, within which the fantastic elements remain contained. A
          portal-quest fantasy typically tends to be a quest-type
          narrative, whose main challenge is navigating the fantastical
          world.^[38] Notable examples include L. Frank Baum's novel The
          Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), C. S. Lewis' novel The Lion, the
          Witch and the Wardrobe (1950),^[39] and Stephen R. Donaldson's
          series The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (late 1970s).^[40] In
          Japan, the genre of portal fantasy is known as isekai (Japanese:
          異世界; transl. "different world" or "otherworld"), which has
          developed its own set of conventions.

   Immersive fantasy
          In immersive fantasy, the fictional world is seen as complete;
          its fantastic elements remain unquestioned within the context of
          the story; and the reader perceives the world through the eyes
          and ears of characters native to the setting. This narrative
          mode "consciously negates the sense of wonder" often associated
          with science fiction, according to Mendlesohn. She adds that "a
          sufficiently effective immersive fantasy may be
          indistinguishable from science fiction" as the fantastic
          "acquires a scientific cohesion all of its own". This similarity
          has led to disputes about how to classify novels such as Mary
          Gentle's Ash (2000) and China Miéville's Perdido Street Station
          (2000).^[41]

   Intrusion fantasy
          In intrusion fantasy, the fantastic intrudes on reality (as
          portal fantasies do not), and the protagonists' engagement with
          that intrusion drives the story. Usually realist in style, these
          works assume the default world as their basis. Intrusion
--
          Classic intrusion fantasies include the novel Dracula (1897) by
          Bram Stoker and the book Mary Poppins (1934) by P. L.
          Travers.^[43] In French-speaking countries, this genre is called
          fantastique and is considered to be distinct from fantasy.

   Liminal fantasy
          In liminal fantasy, the fantastic enters a world that appears to
          be our own. The marvelous is perceived as normal by the
          protagonists, while it disconcerts and estranges the reader.
          This is a relatively rare mode. Such fantasies often adopt an
          ironic, blasé tone, as opposed to the straight-faced mimesis
          more common in fantasy.^[44] Examples include Joan Aiken's
          stories about the Armitage family, who are amazed that unicorns
          appear on their lawn on a Tuesday, rather than a Monday.^[43]

   Publishers, editors, authors, artists, and scholars who are interested
   in the fantasy genre meet annually at the World Fantasy Convention
   (WFC). The World Fantasy Awards are presented at this convention. The
   first WFC was held in 1975, and it has been held annually since that
   time (in a different city each year).

   In addition, many science fiction conventions, such as Florida's FX
   Show and MegaCon, cater to fantasy and horror fans. Anime conventions,
   such as Ohayocon and Anime Expo, often feature showings of fantasy,
   science fantasy, and dark fantasy series and films; examples include
   Majutsushi Orphen (fantasy), Sailor Moon (urban fantasy), Berserk (dark
   fantasy), and Spirited Away (fantasy). Many science-fiction/fantasy and
   anime conventions also emphasize or cater to one or more of the
   subcultures within the main cultures:
     * the cosplay subculture, in which people make or wear costumes based

     * the large internet subculture, which is devoted to reading and
       writing prose fiction or doujinshi in or related to those genres

   According to 2013 statistics from the fantasy publisher Tor Books, men
   outnumber women by 67% to 33% among writers of historical, epic or high
   fantasy. By contrast, among writers of urban fantasy or paranormal
   romance, 57% are women and 43% are men.^[45]

Analysis

   [edit]

   Fantasy is studied in a number of disciplines including English and
   other language studies, cultural studies, comparative literature,
   history, and medieval studies. Some works draw political, historical,
   and literary connections between medievalism and popular culture.^[46]
--
   uncertainty about their existence.^[47] However, this precise
   definition is not predominant in English critical literature; the
   French term fantastique is used to differentiate the French concept
   from the broader English term fantastic, a synonym of fantasy.
   Todorov's restrictive definition and differences in national critical
   traditions have led to controversies such as the one initiated by
   Stanislaw Lem.^[48]

   Rosemary Jackson builds on and also challenges Todorov's definition of
   the fantastic in her book Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion (1981).
   Jackson rejects the notion of the genre as a vessel for wish
   fulfillment that transcends human reality in worlds presented as
   superior to our own; instead she posits that the genre is inseparable

   Fantasy is a genre of speculative fiction that involves supernatural or
   magical elements, often including completely imaginary realms and
   creatures.^[1]^[2]

   The genre's roots lie in fantasy literature and drama. From the
   twentieth century onward, it has expanded into various media, including
   film, television, graphic novels, manga, animation, and video games.

--
   Anglophone literary critics.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6] An archaic spelling for
   the term is phantasy.^[7]

   Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction
   and horror by an absence of scientific or macabre themes, although
   these can occur in fantasy. In popular culture, the fantasy genre
   predominantly features settings that reflect the actual Earth, but with
   some sense of otherness.^[8]

   Many works of fantasy use magic or other supernatural elements as a
   main plot element, theme, or setting.^[9] Magic, magic practitioners
   (sorcerers, witches and so on) and magical creatures are common in many
   of these worlds.^[7]

   An identifying trait of fantasy is the author's use of narrative
   elements that do not have to rely on history or nature to be
   coherent.^[10] This differs from realistic fiction in that realistic
   fiction has to attend to the history and natural laws of reality, where
   fantasy does not. In writing fantasy the author uses worldbuilding to
   create characters, situations, and settings that may not be possible in
   reality.

   Many fantasy authors use real-world folklore and mythology as
   inspiration;^[11] and although another defining characteristic of the
   fantasy genre is the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as
   magic,^[12] this does not have to be the case.

   Fantasy has often been compared to science fiction and horror because
   they are the major categories of speculative fiction. Fantasy is
   distinguished from science fiction by the plausibility of the narrative
   elements. A science fiction narrative is unlikely, though seemingly
   possible through logical scientific or technological extrapolation,
   where fantasy narratives do not need to be scientifically
   possible.^[10] Authors have to rely on the readers' suspension of
   disbelief, an acceptance of the unbelievable or impossible for the sake
   of enjoyment, in order to write effective fantasies. Despite both
   genres' heavy reliance on the supernatural, fantasy and horror are
   distinguishable from one another. Horror primarily evokes fear through
   the protagonists' weaknesses or inability to deal with the
   antagonists.^[13]

   While elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were part of
   literature from its beginning, fantasy elements also occur throughout
   ancient religious texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh.^[14] The ancient
   Babylonian creation epic, the Enûma Eliš, in which the god Marduk slays
   the goddess Tiamat,^[15] reflects the theme of cosmic conflict between
   good and evil, which is characteristic of the modern fantasy
   genre.^[15] Genres of romantic and fantasy literature also existed in
   ancient Egypt.^[16] The Tales of the Court of King Khufu, which is
   preserved in the Westcar Papyrus and was probably written in the middle
   of the second half of the eighteenth century BC, preserves a mixture of
   stories with elements of historical fiction, fantasy, and
   satire.^[17]^[18] Egyptian funerary texts preserve mythological
   tales,^[16] the most significant of which are the myths of Osiris and
   his son Horus.^[16]
--
   which an Athenian man persuades the world's birds to build a city in
   the clouds and thereby challenges Zeus's authority.^[20] Ovid's
   Metamorphoses and Apuleius's The Golden Ass are both works that
   influenced the development of the fantasy genre^[20] by taking mythic
   elements and weaving them into personal accounts.^[20] Both works
   involve complex narratives in which humans beings are transformed into
   animals or inanimate objects.^[20] Platonic teachings and early
   Christian theology are major influences on the modern fantasy
   genre.^[20] Plato used allegories to convey many of his teachings,^[20]
   and early Christian writers interpreted both the Old and New Testaments
   as employing parables to convey spiritual truths.^[20] This ability to
   find meaning in a story that is not literally true became the
   foundation for developing the modern fantasy genre.^[20]

   Islamic, Hindu, and Chinese sources contain fantasy elements as well.
   The best-known fiction from the Islamic world is One Thousand and One
   Nights (The Arabian Nights), which is a compilation of ancient and
   medieval folk tales. Various characters from this epic have become
--
   particularly in the Indian epics. The Panchatantra (Fables of Bidpai),
   for example, used animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the
   central Indian principles of political science. Chinese traditions have
   been particularly influential in the vein of fantasy known as
   Chinoiserie, which includes such writers as Ernest Bramah and Barry
   Hughart.^[21]

   Beowulf is among the best known of the Old English tales in the
   English-speaking world, and it has deeply influenced the fantasy genre;
   several fantasy works have retold the story, for example, John
   Gardner's novel Grendel.^[22] Norse mythology, as found in the Elder
   Edda and Younger Edda collections, includes such figures as the god
   Odin and his fellow Aesir, in addition to dwarves, elves, dragons, and
   giants.^[23] These elements have been directly imported into various
   fantasy works. The distinct folklores of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland
   have sometimes been used indiscriminately for "Celtic" fantasy,
   sometimes with great success; other writers have specified the use of a
   single source.^[24] The Welsh tradition has been particularly
   influential, because of its connection to the legendary King Arthur and
   its collection into a single work, the epic Mabinogion.^[24]

   There are many works where the boundary between fantasy and other
   genres is unclear: did the writers believe in the possibility of the
   marvels in the play A Midsummer Night's Dream or the romance in Sir
   Gawain and the Green Knight? This question makes it difficult to
   distinguish when fantasy began, in its modern sense.^[25]

   and the Goblin

   Although pre-dated by John Ruskin's story The King of the Golden River
   (1841), the history of modern fantasy literature is usually said to
   begin with George MacDonald, the Scottish author of such novels as
   Phantastes (1858) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872); the former is
   widely considered to be the first fantasy novel ever written for
   adults. MacDonald was a major influence on both J. R. R. Tolkien and C.
   S. Lewis.^[26] The other major fantasy author of this era was William
   Morris, an English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of
   the century, including The Wood Beyond the World (1894) and The Well at
   the World's End (1896).
--
   Despite MacDonald's future influence with the novel At the Back of the
   North Wind (1871), Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, and H.
   G. Wells's novel The Wonderful Visit (1895), it was not until the 20th
   century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. Lord
   Dunsany established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the
   short story forms. H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, and Edgar Rice
   Burroughs began to write fantasy around this time. These authors, along
   with Abraham Merritt, established what was known as the lost world
   subgenre; this was the most popular form of fantasy in the early
   decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's
   fantasies, such as Peter Pan and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, were also
   published around this time.

   Juvenile fantasy was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended
   for adults, with the consequence that writers who wished to write
   fantasy for adults needed to fit their work into forms aimed at
   children.^[27] Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote fantasy in A Wonder-Book for
   Girls and Boys, intended for children,^[28] although his works for
   adults only verged on fantasy. For many years, this book and successes
   such as the novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) created a
   circular effect: all fantasy works, even the later series The Lord of
   the Rings, were therefore classified as children's
   literature.^[citation needed]

   Political and social trends can affect a society's reception of
   fantasy. In the early 20th century, the New Culture Movement's
   enthusiasm for Westernization and science in China compelled them to
   condemn the fantastical shenmo genre of traditional Chinese literature.
   The spells and magical creatures in these novels were viewed as
   superstitious and backward, products of a feudal society hindering the
   modernization of China. Stories of the supernatural continued to be
   denounced once the Communists rose to power, and mainland China
   experienced a revival in fantasy only after the Cultural Revolution had
   ended.^[29]

   Fantasy became a genre of pulp magazines published in the West. The
   first all-fantasy fiction magazine, Weird Tales, was published in 1923.
   Many similar magazines eventually followed, including The Magazine of
   Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF). When this magazine was founded in
   1949, the pulp format was at the height of its popularity; F&SF was
   instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the
   US and the UK. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of
   science fiction, and the two genres were first associated with each
   other around this time.
--
   By 1950, sword and sorcery fiction had begun to find a wider audience,
   with the success of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories and
   Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories.^[30] However, it was
   the advent of high fantasy—especially J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The
   Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, which reached new heights of
   popularity in the late 1960s—that allowed fantasy to enter the
   mainstream.^[31] Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's The
   Chronicles of Narnia and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea, helped to cement
   the genre's popularity.

   The popularity of the fantasy genre has continued to increase in the
   21st century, as evidenced by the best-selling status of several
   series: J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter, Robert Jordan's The Wheel of
   Time, George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, Steven Erikson's

   hide dice rolls from the players.

   Fantasy role-playing games (RPGs) span several media. Dungeons &
   Dragons (D&D) was the first tabletop role-playing game, and it remains
   the most successful and influential. According to a 1999 survey in the
   United States, six percent of 12- to 35-year-olds have played

   D&D.^[32] Products branded Dungeons & Dragons accounted for over fifty
   percent of the RPG products sold in 2005.^[33]

   The science fantasy role-playing game series Final Fantasy has been an
   icon of the role-playing video game genre. (As of 2012^[update], it was
   still among the top ten best-selling video game franchises.) The first
   collectible card game, Magic: The Gathering, has a fantasy theme and is
   similarly dominant in the industry.^[34]

   [edit]

   In her book Rhetorics of Fantasy (2008),^[36] Farah Mendlesohn proposes
   a taxonomy of fantasy, as "determined by the means by which the
   fantastic enters the narrated world."^[37] (She notes some fantasies
   fit none of the patterns in this taxonomy.) The taxonomy categories are
   as follows:

   Portal fantasy
          In portal-quest fantasy or portal fantasy, a fantasy world is
          entered, within which the fantastic elements remain contained. A
          portal-quest fantasy typically tends to be a quest-type
          narrative, whose main challenge is navigating the fantastical
          world.^[38] Notable examples include L. Frank Baum's novel The
          Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), C. S. Lewis' novel The Lion, the
          Witch and the Wardrobe (1950),^[39] and Stephen R. Donaldson's
          series The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (late 1970s).^[40] In
          Japan, the genre of portal fantasy is known as isekai (Japanese:
          異世界; transl. "different world" or "otherworld"), which has
          developed its own set of conventions.

   Immersive fantasy
          In immersive fantasy, the fictional world is seen as complete;
          its fantastic elements remain unquestioned within the context of
          the story; and the reader perceives the world through the eyes
          and ears of characters native to the setting. This narrative
          mode "consciously negates the sense of wonder" often associated
          with science fiction, according to Mendlesohn. She adds that "a
          sufficiently effective immersive fantasy may be
          indistinguishable from science fiction" as the fantastic
          "acquires a scientific cohesion all of its own". This similarity
          has led to disputes about how to classify novels such as Mary
          Gentle's Ash (2000) and China Miéville's Perdido Street Station
          (2000).^[41]

   Intrusion fantasy
          In intrusion fantasy, the fantastic intrudes on reality (as
          portal fantasies do not), and the protagonists' engagement with
          that intrusion drives the story. Usually realist in style, these
          works assume the default world as their basis. Intrusion
--
          Classic intrusion fantasies include the novel Dracula (1897) by
          Bram Stoker and the book Mary Poppins (1934) by P. L.
          Travers.^[43] In French-speaking countries, this genre is called
          fantastique and is considered to be distinct from fantasy.

   Liminal fantasy
          In liminal fantasy, the fantastic enters a world that appears to
          be our own. The marvelous is perceived as normal by the
          protagonists, while it disconcerts and estranges the reader.
          This is a relatively rare mode. Such fantasies often adopt an
          ironic, blasé tone, as opposed to the straight-faced mimesis
          more common in fantasy.^[44] Examples include Joan Aiken's
          stories about the Armitage family, who are amazed that unicorns
          appear on their lawn on a Tuesday, rather than a Monday.^[43]

   Publishers, editors, authors, artists, and scholars who are interested
   in the fantasy genre meet annually at the World Fantasy Convention
   (WFC). The World Fantasy Awards are presented at this convention. The
   first WFC was held in 1975, and it has been held annually since that
   time (in a different city each year).

   In addition, many science fiction conventions, such as Florida's FX
   Show and MegaCon, cater to fantasy and horror fans. Anime conventions,
   such as Ohayocon and Anime Expo, often feature showings of fantasy,
   science fantasy, and dark fantasy series and films; examples include
   Majutsushi Orphen (fantasy), Sailor Moon (urban fantasy), Berserk (dark
   fantasy), and Spirited Away (fantasy). Many science-fiction/fantasy and
   anime conventions also emphasize or cater to one or more of the
   subcultures within the main cultures:
     * the cosplay subculture, in which people make or wear costumes based
--
     * the large internet subculture, which is devoted to reading and
       writing prose fiction or doujinshi in or related to those genres

   According to 2013 statistics from the fantasy publisher Tor Books, men
   outnumber women by 67% to 33% among writers of historical, epic or high
   fantasy. By contrast, among writers of urban fantasy or paranormal
   romance, 57% are women and 43% are men.^[45]

Analysis

   [edit]

   Fantasy is studied in a number of disciplines including English and
   other language studies, cultural studies, comparative literature,
   history, and medieval studies. Some works draw political, historical,
   and literary connections between medievalism and popular culture.^[46]
--
   uncertainty about their existence.^[47] However, this precise
   definition is not predominant in English critical literature; the
   French term fantastique is used to differentiate the French concept
   from the broader English term fantastic, a synonym of fantasy.
   Todorov's restrictive definition and differences in national critical
   traditions have led to controversies such as the one initiated by
   Stanislaw Lem.^[48]

   Rosemary Jackson builds on and also challenges Todorov's definition of
   the fantastic in her book Fantasy: The Literature of Subversion (1981).
   Jackson rejects the notion of the genre as a vessel for wish
   fulfillment that transcends human reality in worlds presented as
   superior to our own; instead she posits that the genre is inseparable
