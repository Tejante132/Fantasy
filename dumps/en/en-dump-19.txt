18 Common Fantasy Subgenres

   Fantasy novels take on many forms, and the number of distinct fantasy
   subgenres seems to grow with each passing year. Here are 18
   particularly important subgenres within the world of fantasy:
    1. 1. Dystopian fantasy: Sometimes grouped in with science fiction,
       speculative fiction, and literary fiction, dystopian fantasies
       imagine worlds gone wrong. The settings are at once familiar to
       contemporary audiences and also alarmingly worse than the present
       world. Jack Vance’s Dying Earth series is a pulpy example of this
       subgenre of fantasy fiction.
    2. 2. High fantasy: Sometimes called “epic fantasy,” high fantasy is
       set in a magical environment that has its own rules and physical
       laws. This subgenre’s plots and themes have a grand scale and
       typically center on a single, well-developed hero or a band of
       heroes, such as Frodo Baggins and his cohorts in J.R.R. Tolkien’s
       The Lord of the Rings or Bilbo Baggins and the dwarves in The
       Hobbit. George R.R. Martin combines high fantasy with elements of
       medieval fantasy and romance in his Song of Ice and Fire series
       (and the Game of Thrones television series based upon those books).
    3. 3. Low fantasy: Set in the real world, low fantasy includes
       unexpected magical elements that surprise ordinary characters, like
       the plastic figurines come to life in Lynne Reid Banks’s The Indian
       in the Cupboard.
    4. 4. Magical realism: While similar to low fantasy, magical realism
       characters accept fantastical elements like levitation and
       telekinesis as a normal part of their otherwise realistic world, as
       in Gabriel García Márquez’s magical realism classic One Hundred
       Years of Solitude.
    5. 5. Sword and sorcery: A subset of high fantasy, this subgenre
       focuses on sword-wielding heroes—such as the titular barbarian in
       Robert E. Howard’s Conan pulp fiction stories—as well as magic or
       witchcraft. J.K. Rowling popularized the sword and sorcery subgenre
       for young adults with her Harry Potter series.
    6. 6. Urban fantasy: Urban fantasy is a genre of literature
       encompassing novels, novellas, and short stories in which
       fantastical characters and concepts are placed in a real world
       urban setting, often in the present day. Urban fantasy novels have
       devoted followings and they have spawned film and TV adaptations.
       Urban fantasy stories often draw from noir and gritty police
       procedurals. They also may incorporate fantastical elements and
       supernatural creatures. These could involve undead zombies,
       vampires, druids, demons, wizardry, witchcraft, and other such
       fantasy tropes. The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher is an example of
       urban fantasy.
    7. 7. Paranormal romance: This fantasy subgenre combines romantic
       themes with fantasy elements like vampires, werewolves, shifters,
       faeries, and zombie armies. Many contemporary fantasy series blur
       the line between urban fantasy stories, coming-of-age tales, and
       paranormal romances. Patricia Briggs and Jeaniene Frost are popular
       authors in this subgenre.
    8. 8. Dark fantasy: Combining elements of fantasy with the horror
       genre, dark fantasy’s aim is to unnerve and frighten readers. For
       example, consider the gargantuan, otherworldly monsters in H. P.
       Lovecraft’s universe. Gothic and Victorian dark fantasy tends to
       embrace a paranormal setting and supernatural elements, which can
       range from vampires to werewolves and beyond. Note that by no means
       is every paranormal fantasy a dark fantasy.
    9. 9. Grimdark fantasy: One step beyond dark fantasy, grimdark novels
       pry into the blackest depths of the human condition, often in the
       proverbial underbelly of an alternate world. The Court of Broken
       Knives by Anna Smith Spark is a popular book within this subgenre.
   10. 10. Fables: Using personified animals and the supernatural, fables
       impart moral lessons, like the stories in Aesop’s Fables and
       Arabian Nights.
   11. 11. Fairy Tales: Intended for children, fairy tales and folk tales
       are typically set in distant magical worlds (with beginnings like
       “Once upon a time, in a land far, far away…”) where trolls,
       dragons, witches, and other supernatural characters are an accepted
       truth, as in the Brothers Grimm’s Grimms’ Fairy Tales.
   12. 12. Superhero fantasy: Unlike stories in which a hero acquires
       special abilities through scientific means, such as exposure to
       radiation, the protagonists’ powers in more fantastical superhero
       stories are supernatural. Many superhero stories are set in a low
       fantasy world—one that’s quite similar to our own world.
       Superheroes ranging from Wonder Woman to Thor bring fantasy
       elements to worlds that otherwise obey the known laws of science.
       Many superhero fantasy authors have worked in the comic book
       medium, from Stan Lee to Bob Kane. As such, superhero fiction in
       the fantasy genre is also known as comic fantasy or comic book
       fantasy.
   13. 13. Fantasy of manners: This subgenre, exemplified by fantasy books
       like Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake, combines supernatural
       world-building with the type of society-centric concerns one might
       encounter in a work by Edith Wharton or Noel Coward. Human drama
       and pettiness may outweigh magical powers in this subgenre of
       fantasy literature.
   14. 14. Crossworlds fantasy: Sometimes called portal fantasy, this
       subgenre involves characters transporting from a normal world to a
       magical one. This requires authors to engage in both magical
       world-building and grounded realistic world-building. Crossworlds
       fantasy stories often appeal to children, as seen in the Chronicles
       of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis and Alice in Wonderland by Lewis
       Carroll. These works also fit a category known as juvenile fantasy.
   15. 15. Steampunk fantasy: This highly specific subgenre combines the
       Victorian science and technology of the Industrial Revolution with
       contemporary takes on robots and machines. As such, steampunk
       fantasy is at once alternate history, science fantasy, and a modern
       fantasy—although the specifics vary with specific novels. Soulless
       by Gail Carriger is a particularly well-regarded steampunk fantasy
       novel.
   16. 16. Arthurian fantasy: These historical fantasy stories exist in a
       magical world of King Arthur, although Arthur himself is not always
       the main character. Due to their magical setting, Arthurian fantasy
       novels and short stories tend to feature mythic creatures like
       dragons, and many of their heroes are knights—which also makes them
       part of the heroic fantasy subgenre.
   17. 17. Sci-fi fantasy: These stories can be set in any variety of time
       periods—which means they can be a contemporary fantasy, a modern
       fantasy, a futuristic fantasy, or even historical fantasy—but they
       establish a new world where scientific advancements have changed
       the rules of engagement, while still incorporating magical
       elements. The Star Wars series and the various works of Isaac
       Asimov have helped set the bar for sci-fi fantasy.
   18. 18. Wuxia fantasy: This subgenre is rooted in classic Chinese
       literature. It involves elements of fantasy interspersed with
       martial arts. Jade City by Fonda Lee is an example of wuxia
       fantasy.

       fantasy tropes. The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher is an example of
       urban fantasy.
    7. 7. Paranormal romance: This fantasy subgenre combines romantic
       themes with fantasy elements like vampires, werewolves, shifters,
       faeries, and zombie armies. Many contemporary fantasy series blur
       the line between urban fantasy stories, coming-of-age tales, and
       paranormal romances. Patricia Briggs and Jeaniene Frost are popular
       authors in this subgenre.
    8. 8. Dark fantasy: Combining elements of fantasy with the horror
       genre, dark fantasy’s aim is to unnerve and frighten readers. For
       example, consider the gargantuan, otherworldly monsters in H. P.
       Lovecraft’s universe. Gothic and Victorian dark fantasy tends to
       embrace a paranormal setting and supernatural elements, which can
       range from vampires to werewolves and beyond. Note that by no means
       is every paranormal fantasy a dark fantasy.
    9. 9. Grimdark fantasy: One step beyond dark fantasy, grimdark novels
       pry into the blackest depths of the human condition, often in the
       proverbial underbelly of an alternate world. The Court of Broken
       Knives by Anna Smith Spark is a popular book within this subgenre.
   10. 10. Fables: Using personified animals and the supernatural, fables
       impart moral lessons, like the stories in Aesop’s Fables and
       Arabian Nights.
   11. 11. Fairy Tales: Intended for children, fairy tales and folk tales
       are typically set in distant magical worlds (with beginnings like
       “Once upon a time, in a land far, far away…”) where trolls,
       dragons, witches, and other supernatural characters are an accepted
       truth, as in the Brothers Grimm’s Grimms’ Fairy Tales.
   12. 12. Superhero fantasy: Unlike stories in which a hero acquires
       special abilities through scientific means, such as exposure to
       radiation, the protagonists’ powers in more fantastical superhero
       stories are supernatural. Many superhero stories are set in a low
       fantasy world—one that’s quite similar to our own world.
       Superheroes ranging from Wonder Woman to Thor bring fantasy
       elements to worlds that otherwise obey the known laws of science.
       Many superhero fantasy authors have worked in the comic book
       medium, from Stan Lee to Bob Kane. As such, superhero fiction in
       the fantasy genre is also known as comic fantasy or comic book
       fantasy.
   13. 13. Fantasy of manners: This subgenre, exemplified by fantasy books
       like Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake, combines supernatural
       world-building with the type of society-centric concerns one might
       encounter in a work by Edith Wharton or Noel Coward. Human drama
       and pettiness may outweigh magical powers in this subgenre of
       fantasy literature.
   14. 14. Crossworlds fantasy: Sometimes called portal fantasy, this
       subgenre involves characters transporting from a normal world to a
       magical one. This requires authors to engage in both magical
       world-building and grounded realistic world-building. Crossworlds
       fantasy stories often appeal to children, as seen in the Chronicles
       of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis and Alice in Wonderland by Lewis
       Carroll. These works also fit a category known as juvenile fantasy.
   15. 15. Steampunk fantasy: This highly specific subgenre combines the
       Victorian science and technology of the Industrial Revolution with
       contemporary takes on robots and machines. As such, steampunk
       fantasy is at once alternate history, science fantasy, and a modern
       fantasy—although the specifics vary with specific novels. Soulless
       by Gail Carriger is a particularly well-regarded steampunk fantasy
       novel.
   16. 16. Arthurian fantasy: These historical fantasy stories exist in a
       magical world of King Arthur, although Arthur himself is not always
       the main character. Due to their magical setting, Arthurian fantasy
       novels and short stories tend to feature mythic creatures like
       dragons, and many of their heroes are knights—which also makes them
       part of the heroic fantasy subgenre.
   17. 17. Sci-fi fantasy: These stories can be set in any variety of time
       periods—which means they can be a contemporary fantasy, a modern
       fantasy, a futuristic fantasy, or even historical fantasy—but they
       establish a new world where scientific advancements have changed
       the rules of engagement, while still incorporating magical
       elements. The Star Wars series and the various works of Isaac
       Asimov have helped set the bar for sci-fi fantasy.
   18. 18. Wuxia fantasy: This subgenre is rooted in classic Chinese
       literature. It involves elements of fantasy interspersed with
       martial arts. Jade City by Fonda Lee is an example of wuxia
       fantasy.
