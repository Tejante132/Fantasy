Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       Barry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to
       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Images
       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19

       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice

       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       In the interest of full disclosure, here is my team for the
       weekend.
       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.
       But I am no expert, so let's get your first question to someone who
       is.

Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Graphic showing Pedro Porro and Dan Burn Image source, Getty Images
       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       Barry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to
       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

Should you swap Ekitike for Isak?published at 16:04 BST 19 September 2025

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19

15:50 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.

Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Graphic showing Pedro Porro and Dan Burn Image source, Getty Images
       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Erling Haaland Image source, Getty Images
       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       Barry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to
       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Images
       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

Should you swap Ekitike for Isak?published at 16:04 BST 19 September 2025

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19
September 2025

15:50 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice

       Gabriel and Marcos Senesi Image source, Getty Images
       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       BBC Sport journalist
       In the interest of full disclosure, here is my team for the
       weekend.
       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.
       But I am no expert, so let's get your first question to someone who
       is.

Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Erling Haaland Image source, Getty Images
       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       Barry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to
       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Images
       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19

       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.

          + Who's the next best captain after Salah and Palmer?

Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

16:45 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Graphic showing Pedro Porro and Dan Burn Image source, Getty Images
       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

Should you give up on some players?published at 16:41 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Florian Wirtz Image source, Getty Images
       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

Who's the next best captain after Salah and Palmer?published at 16:19 BST 19

       Barry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to
       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

Should you swap Ekitike for Isak?published at 16:04 BST 19 September 2025

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       In the interest of full disclosure, here is my team for the

       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.
       But I am no expert, so let's get your first question to someone who
       is.

Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Graphic showing Pedro Porro and Dan Burn Image source, Getty Images
       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Erling Haaland Image source, Getty Images
       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Images
       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

Should you swap Ekitike for Isak?published at 16:04 BST 19 September 2025

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice

       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice

       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       In the interest of full disclosure, here is my team for the
       weekend.
       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.
       But I am no expert, so let's get your first question to someone who
       is.

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.
       The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if
       things go wrong though right?

Should you swap Ekitike for Isak?published at 16:04 BST 19 September 2025

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19

       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

Who can replace Wirtz?published at 16:48 BST 19 September 2025

       Richard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if
       we already have Antoine Semenyo?
       I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find
       the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but
       Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Pedro Porro or Dan Burn?published at 16:45 BST 19 September 2025

       Gianni Buttice

       Graphic showing Pedro Porro and Dan Burn Image source, Getty Images
       Mari: Got three of my back four – Marc Guehi, Daniel Muñoz, and
       James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and
       Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back
       line?
       There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after
       playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away
       trips this weekend are surely likely to concede.
       I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional
       points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers
       higher goal threat and defcon potential. Pedro Porro edges it for
       me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. It’s a
       50/50.

       Bob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian
       Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last
       week to prove they’re not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to
       settle perhaps.
       Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week,
       especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily
       on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want
       to avoid that.
       It’s been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could
       give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Haaland or Ekitike for captaincy?published at 16:30 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Erling Haaland Image source, Getty Images
       Matthew: I’m not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling
       Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the
       play?
       Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isn’t guaranteed and 90
       minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man
       Haaland.
       Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally
       I don’t love the upside that it offers this week with very few
       fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's
       team dependent.
       Ideally you’re looking for weeks where there are a handful of the
       top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Should you transfer Watkins out this week?published at 16:25 BST 19 September

       Ollie Watkins Image source, Getty Images
       Mo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I
       need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard.
       Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one
       more week" and if you’re on wildcard it's even easier to offload.
       You’re absolutely right, you do need Haaland if you’re on wildcard
       and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the
       Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa
       do win and Watkins does score, I can’t see him getting more than
       one goal and the damage won’t be too brutal for sellers.

       Barry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to
       captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd,
       unfortunately). Who is the next best captain?
       Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so that’s where I would
       go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a
       full week on the training ground.

       Well would you look at that...
       Maybe I am an expert after all.

Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?published at 16:12 BST 19 September 2025

       Franek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question:
       Mo Salah or Erling Haaland?
       This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I
       prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and
       I wonder if the answer is actually to own both.
       Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough
       good budget players this year I think it’s a legit option. Owning
       both however could block moves for players that I like and want to
       own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal
       defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look
       optimal in a month’s time.

       things go wrong though right?

Should you swap Ekitike for Isak?published at 16:04 BST 19 September 2025

       Stephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I
       have now, over the season but should I swap them before this
       weekend or wait? I have the money.
       Arne Slot didn’t give much away in his presser this morning and I
       expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting
       which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very
       difficult.
       I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I
       would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didn’t start in the
       week and then save the transfer.

What separates the good and the best FPL managers?published at 15:59 BST 19

       Andrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the
       good FPL managers from the best FPL managers?
       That’s the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL
       managers are those that consistently hit good ranks.
       In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top
       1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season. Picking the
       right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in
       players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test
       scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having
       luck on your side of course.

BBC Sport's team of the weekpublished at 15:55 BST 19 September 2025

15:55 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Thomas Woods
       BBC Sport FPL writer, best finish 9,100th
       Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a
       place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals -
       in the FPL team of the week.
       Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland
       and Mohamed Salah.
       While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against
       opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to
       concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.
       What you do long term with those two assets is a different
       question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL
       Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's
       Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.
       Team cost: £97m
       The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit
       within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

What about captaining a defender this week?published at 15:50 BST 19
September 2025

15:50 BST 19 September 2025
       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice
       FPL expert and eight-time top-50k finisher
       Maxence Lacroix Image source, Getty Images
       Chris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures
       don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example,
       Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight
       with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham
       have been poor at defending. Plus bonus!
       We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we
       should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out
       Chris, because Defcon has changed the game.
       Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more
       often than not and I understand why you would consider him. There
       are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always
       prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand
       the amount of times I’ve captained a defender in over 10 years of
       playing.
       Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my
       favourite options this week.

Who to replace the injured Murillo?published at 15:45 BST 19 September 2025

       FPL Q&A with Gianni Buttice
       Gianni Buttice

       Gabriel and Marcos Senesi Image source, Getty Images
       Jack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements
       this week for Murillo?
       Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his
       replacement all week.
       I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi. If
       you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a
       long-term play. They’re clearly the best defence in the league and
       their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7.
       Meanwhile Bournemouth’s Senesi has picked up the additional two
       defensive contribution points in all four of his games – one of
       only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from
       four.

       In the interest of full disclosure, here is my team for the
       weekend.
       And yes, that is Erling Haaland and Mo Salah in the starting XI.
       But I am no expert, so let's get your first question to someone who
       is.
