Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?
   [trust.jpg]
   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.
   [RedWinter_dust-jacket-1.jpg]
   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.
   [THE-MISHEARD-WORLD_.jpg]
   The Misheard World by Aliya Whiteley - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Before wars are won, they must be witnessed.
   Elize Janview is a soldier, one of the few survivors of an unimaginably
   terrible weapon, which ended the long détente between the North and the
   South and plunged them back into all-out war. She enlisted with a dream
   of finding those responsible, of somehow getting revenge for the deaths
   of everyone she knew, but was posted to guard the prison at Crag, the
   fortress of the South, which has never fallen to the enemy.
   Janview’s life is transformed when a rough wooden box is delivered to
   Crag, holding the performer and spy Marius Mondegreen, agent of the
   North: the Misheard Word, who can read minds, breathe fire, and make
   objects appear and disappear. Janview is to witness Mondegreen’s
   interrogation by his captor, the beautiful and cruel Allynx Syld, who
   promises the end of the war. As recorder – and by degrees participant –
   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew

   con to bring down the Librarian. Unfortunately, Allaster is as prickly
   as he is handsome, and his monstrous secrets are about to catch up with

   leave the city forever. But Ottilie's sisters – Pretoria, a
   quick-witted sorceress and thief recently emerged from exile, and
   Madge, a guild mage to the core, appear to make equally unwelcome
   offers. A new life at the cost of everything she has ever wanted, or
   prestige and safety in a gilded cage.

   city torn apart by prejudice and violence, and choose between the two
   sides of herself – the fugitive and the Entwined.

   monsters.

   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,
   magic, and mayhem? Her encyclopedic knowledge of the plot, the setting,
   and the characters' ambitions and fates. But while she quickly
   discovers she cannot be killed (though many will try!), the same cannot
   be said for the living, breathing characters she's coming to love―a
   motley band that includes a former lady’s maid, a deadly assassin,
   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.
   Soon, instead of trying to get home, she finds herself enmeshed in the
   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all
   while trying to save them and the kingdom of Rellas from the way she
   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.

   What ensues is a nightmare beyond imagination, an escalation of horrors

   Japanese Gothic by Kylie Lee Baker - Apr 21, 2026
   Official Blurb: October, 2026: Lee Turner doesn’t remember how or why
   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.

   imperial soldiers in a house behind the sword ferns. A monster came

   soldiers will soon slaughter her whole family when she sees a terrible
   omen: a young foreign man who appears outside her window.
   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   A River Red With Blood by John Connolly - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: The players call it the Game, and its aim is simple: to

   Killing Outside the Game.
   But those rules have been broken.
   When the drowned body of a troubled teenager is recovered from a river
   in Maine's Kennebec Valley, and a young woman disappears from a small

   Charlie Parker.
   Now Parker will be forced to confront a band of men without morality
   and without loyalty, not even to one another, in a place where the very

   Sisters of the Lizard by Jackson Ford - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: All Sayana wanted was to enjoy her life in the rolling
   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   Outlaw by Jim Butcher - May 12, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a city that’s just beginning to recover from the
   devastation caused by the Battle of Chicago, Harry Dresden is finally
   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .

   Mortedant's Peril by RJ Barker - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Irody can speak to the dead. But the living want him
   silenced.
   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the
   city’s guilds, nobles and villains all fixed on him.
   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a
   hulking, inhuman mercenary from the sea people’s city of Oknosuka. With
   danger and death lurking round every corner, and trust a luxury, Irody
   is running out of time. He must save himself and his friends as well as
   Elbay – the magnificent, terrifying, complicated city that he loves. Or
   darkness will fall on them all.

   hunting down magical artifacts for the council of immortal peris, she
   can savour the occasional adventure on the high seas with her cherished
   criminal companions while still returning home to raise her beloved

   impossible quest: steal a spindle capable of rewriting fate from a
   mysterious sorceress on an island no one can escape.
   Forced to leave her daughter, Amina finds her mission almost
   immediately thrown into peril. But deadly storms, an erratic poison
   mistress, and old enemies are the least of her worries. For the peris’
   story is unravelling, hinting at a far deadlier game whose rules Amina
   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.

   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.

   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?

   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and

   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.

   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could

   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful
   minotaur her protector, a sentient skull her tutor, and a blob of
   corridor slime her main source of nutrition.
   But the labyrinthine dungeon, with its haunted halls, buried temples
   and forgotten magics, draws treasure hunters like moths to flame. And
   as the outside world starts to intrude, Bait will learn what it means
   to be monstrous and she will have to decide where she truly belongs.

   The Knave and the Moon by Rachel Gillig - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: Aisling Cathedral is in ruins. Rodrick Myndacious,
   Bartholomew, and Maude Bauer are rumored to be dead—and the king has
   taken Sybil Delling as his bride. To show off their union and solidify
   his power over Traum, Benji proposes a series of tournaments throughout
   the hamlets. Captive and drugged, Sybil remains determined to vanquish
   him as she once did the Omens, even if she destroys the kingdom’s
   faith—and herself—in the process.
   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.

   Blacktail by Scott Hawkins - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: The wolf Blacktail is faithful to his Forest God, but
   in these times, faith is not enough. His world is besieged by men. Soon
   his territory will be overrun, and then there will be nowhere left to
   go. When his mate, a house dog, is killed, Blacktail rebels. He invades
   the house of her owners, seeking vengeance.
   Blacktail’s fury catches the notice of an ancient and terrible feline
   witch, who makes an offer. What if Blacktail could end the human race
   responsible for the death of his family and for the destruction of the
   natural world, altogether? To do so, Blacktail must find and wake the
   Forest God. Only He might stand against the plague of men. Blacktail
   knows that his north woods are dwindling to nothing. He sees no other
   choice.
   As Blacktail journeys farther from his wild home and deeper into the
   world of man, he encounters strangers—animal, mortal, and
   otherworldly—who, for their own reasons, want to help Blacktail rid the
   world of humans. Along the way, it becomes clear that he is more than
   just a wolf. The Forest God is sleeping, yes. But what will be the
   price of waking him?

   Exit Party by Emily St. John Mendel - Sep 15, 2026
   Official Blurb: Los Angeles, 2031: The first spring after the collapse
   of the United States, peacekeeping troops withdraw from the city, the
   Jacaranda trees blossom, and the curfew is finally lifted. Ari Waker
   and her roommate pass the gauntlet of bomb-sniffing dogs, the shanty
   towns, and the Red Cross tents as they walk across Silverlake to a
   party. The mood is ecstatic inside the apartment, people drink and
   dance, a woman wears a silver dress, pleated like tinfoil. And then: A
   shift. A bewildered twin, an uncanny doppelganger stumbles through the
   crowd and out into the night, and Kareem, the party’s host, vanishes
   into thin air.
   As Ari Waker unravels the mystery of this inexplicable night, Emily St.
   John Mandel unfurls a story that takes us from a future America
   splintered by civil war to the seaside cliffs of Greece where weapons
   dealers hide in an elegant resort, and from the domed city of Paris to
   a colony on the moon. An unforgettable literary feat, Exit Party is a
   novel about the price of safety, the perils of the surveillance state,
   a requiem for a world not unlike our own, and a breathtaking story of
   resilience in the face of cataclysmic change.

   Incarnate by Alma Katsu - Sep 22, 2026
   Official Blurb: Beauty doesn’t fade. It feeds.
   Marion Wagner has spent her whole life wanting nothing more than to be
   seen. But after failing to make her mark (any mark, really) as an
   influencer, she takes a job at a company focused on cutting-edge
   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her
   salvation.
   Isabella. An impossibly gorgeous girl who takes social media by storm.
   Marion’s code is brilliant, and Isabella seems real. So real that she
   garners millions of followers. Brands beg to partner with her. Everyone
   wants to meet her IRL. The adoration—and the cash—flows in. Marion is
   finally happy. She's getting all the attention she ever wanted—isn't
   she?
   Then the cracks begin to show. Marion can barely stay ahead of the
   partnership requests, and love letters and the rabid fans filling her
   DMs trying to track Isabella down. All this time working in secret with
   all this pressure is getting to Marion—she can’t tell where she ends,
   and her creation begins. And when someone gets a little too close to
   her secret, a violent confrontation sends Marion on the run, forcing
   her to confront what she’s willing to sacrifice to keep her secrets.

   Nightjars by Michael Wehunt - Sep 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: One rainy night on a first date, Luke Oshel’s new crush
   never comes back from the restroom. But she leaves an old photograph
   under her napkin―Luke as a child, a dead body in the shadows of his
   bedroom, and a terrifying masked man. He has no recollection of this
   event.
   Then more photos disrupt his life���Luke posing with murder victims,
   covered in blood―and he falls back into the deep paranoia and repressed
   memories he’s tried to leave behind. All the drugs and alcohol,
   therapy, and hypnosis sessions have never conquered his deepest
   fear��that he hasn'''t escaped the hidden legacy of his father, who
   killed his victims by exsanguination before his own death. But now
   there is a new string of serial killings, and the evidence all points
   to Luke.
   As his journey to uncover the truth unfolds in the North Georgia
   Appalachians, a threat arises that will risk everything he holds close,
   including his ex-wife and their young daughter. Now Luke must chase his
   father’s darkness through a centuries-old secret and learn what
   monsters truly are. And decide if he’s one of them.

   The Scarlet Ball by Nghi Vo - Oct 6, 2026
   Official Blurb: Judith Ban – convent girl, courtesan, and failed thief
   – is looking for her next identity. She’s no stranger to wealth or
   danger, but the glitter of New York’s Gilded Age hides a darkness even
   she has never imagined. Here, the city’s elite maintain their grip
   through opulent balls, whispered rituals, and marriages with demons
   hungry for human devotion.
   When she crosses paths with the formidable matriarch of the Howard
   family, Judith is offered an irresistible bargain: to take the place of
   a missing debutante in the coming season. With Miss Iphigenia
   Marshall’s face stitched over her own, Judith becomes white, rich, and
   ready to risk it all. If she can hold onto her charm, her wits, and her
   life, her reward will be a husband with undreamt-of power.
   But in a world ruled by appetite and ambition, the most dangerous
   hunger of all might be her own.

   The Splintered Sun by Tad Williams - Oct 6, 2026
   Unofficial Summary: From the much-loved, Sunday Times bestselling
   author comes a thrilling new tale set in the legendary world of Osten
   Ard. This fast-moving adventure follows bandit and chieftain Flann
   Alderwood - a mythic, swashbuckling figure whose name is whispered
   across the realm-and his band of misfit rebels as they navigate a
   kingdom menaced by dark sorcery and war.
   With the old King of Hernystir's health failing, warlords carve up the
   land and rival factions clash over the rightful heir. Into this chaos
   steps Flann, joined by allies both noble and common, to help the King's
   one legitimate heir claim his father's blessing and restore stability.
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to
   end Flann's quest before it begins.
   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.

   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?
   [trust.jpg]
   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.
   [RedWinter_dust-jacket-1.jpg]
   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.
   [THE-MISHEARD-WORLD_.jpg]
   The Misheard World by Aliya Whiteley - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Before wars are won, they must be witnessed.
   Elize Janview is a soldier, one of the few survivors of an unimaginably
   terrible weapon, which ended the long détente between the North and the
   South and plunged them back into all-out war. She enlisted with a dream
   of finding those responsible, of somehow getting revenge for the deaths
   of everyone she knew, but was posted to guard the prison at Crag, the
   fortress of the South, which has never fallen to the enemy.
   Janview’s life is transformed when a rough wooden box is delivered to
   Crag, holding the performer and spy Marius Mondegreen, agent of the
   North: the Misheard Word, who can read minds, breathe fire, and make
   objects appear and disappear. Janview is to witness Mondegreen’s
   interrogation by his captor, the beautiful and cruel Allynx Syld, who
   promises the end of the war. As recorder – and by degrees participant –
   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew
   about the war, and the very world she lives in…

   magical creatures on behalf of the fanatical kingdom of Kalthos.

   an enchanting world brimming with books and beasts, tempting her with a

   con to bring down the Librarian. Unfortunately, Allaster is as prickly
   as he is handsome, and his monstrous secrets are about to catch up with
   them both . . .

   fiancé, the enigmatic poet, soldier and smuggler Lewis Illing. All she
   must do is track down a mysterious artefact, claim the bounty, and
   leave the city forever. But Ottilie's sisters – Pretoria, a
   quick-witted sorceress and thief recently emerged from exile, and
   Madge, a guild mage to the core, appear to make equally unwelcome
   offers. A new life at the cost of everything she has ever wanted, or
   prestige and safety in a gilded cage.
   With her life on the line, Ottilie must track down the artifact in a
   city torn apart by prejudice and violence, and choose between the two
   sides of herself – the fugitive and the Entwined.

   Daughter Of Crows by Mark Lawrence -  Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Set a thief to catch a thief. Set a monster to punish
   monsters.

   The Academy’s halls run with blood. The few that survive its

   Garden. They have learned ancient secrets amid the necrotic fumes of
   the Bone Garden. They leave its gates as avatars of vengeance, bound to
   uphold the oldest of laws.
   Only the most desperate would sell their child to the Kindnesses. But
   Rue … she sold herself. And now, a lifetime later, a long and bloody
   lifetime later, just as she has discovered peace, war has been brought
   to an old woman’s doorstep.
   That was a mistake.

   This Kingdom Will Not Kill Me by Ilona Andrews - Mar 31, 2026
   Official Blurb: When Maggie wakes up cold, filthy, and naked in a

   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,
   magic, and mayhem? Her encyclopedic knowledge of the plot, the setting,
   and the characters' ambitions and fates. But while she quickly
   discovers she cannot be killed (though many will try!), the same cannot
   be said for the living, breathing characters she's coming to love―a
   motley band that includes a former lady’s maid, a deadly assassin,
   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.
   Soon, instead of trying to get home, she finds herself enmeshed in the
   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all
   while trying to save them and the kingdom of Rellas from the way she
   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.

   will try and unpick the final secrets of the Great Silence—on both
   sides of the mortal plane. But time is running out. Count Lamprecht von

   Japanese Gothic by Kylie Lee Baker - Apr 21, 2026
   Official Blurb: October, 2026: Lee Turner doesn’t remember how or why
   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.
   October, 1877: Sen is a young samurai in exile, hiding from the
   imperial soldiers in a house behind the sword ferns. A monster came
   home from war wearing her father’s face, but Sen would do anything to
   please him, even turn her sword on her own mother. She knows the
   soldiers will soon slaughter her whole family when she sees a terrible
   omen: a young foreign man who appears outside her window.
   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   A River Red With Blood by John Connolly - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: The players call it the Game, and its aim is simple: to

   But the past Mercy can’t remember won’t let her go. An unusually
   powerful ghost has infested Kowloon’s waterways, drowning innocents and

   walls may well be one of her own making.

   Official Blurb: LIVE BY THE CODE. DIE BY THE KNIFE.
   Isako is a legendary swordswoman, but every legend must come to an end.
   When her long-time client unexpectedly retires, she plans to follow—to
   walk out into the frozen wasteland of their planet with her head held
   high and her family enriched by her death. But when she's offered a
   final mission, she can't refuse, especially when she realizes who lies
   at the center of it all: Martim, her last—and worst—apprentice, who's
   somehow made his way to the top. As she's thrust into a world of
   corporate espionage and shadowy secrets, what she uncovers could
   forever change humanity's existence among the stars.
   The Last Contract of Isako is epic science fiction like only Fonda Lee
   can write it—set in a world where money trumps loyalty, the elite have
   the power to extend life or end it, and one woman in the twilight of
   her calling must decide what's ultimately worth living—or dying—for.

   Sisters of the Lizard by Jackson Ford - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: All Sayana wanted was to enjoy her life in the rolling
   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   secret—that he has bound a second Symbol—with his life. If the Censors
   knew, they’d execute him on the spot.
   There is only one path to freedom and avenging his family. He must earn
   it no longer as a member of the Iron Legions, but by spilling blood for
   one of the great Houses.
   The dead gods stir in their rotting slumber. Dangerous enemies stalk
   his new master. Surrounded on all sides, Castor must learn the secrets
   of his Cor Heart and reach new heights of power before it is too late.
   And in the wake of his Ascent comes the first sign of change – A COLD
   WIND.

   Outlaw by Jim Butcher - May 12, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a city that’s just beginning to recover from the
   devastation caused by the Battle of Chicago, Harry Dresden is finally
   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .
   [Mortedant.jpg]
   Mortedant's Peril by RJ Barker - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Irody can speak to the dead. But the living want him
   silenced.
   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the
   city’s guilds, nobles and villains all fixed on him.
   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a
   hulking, inhuman mercenary from the sea people’s city of Oknosuka. With
   danger and death lurking round every corner, and trust a luxury, Irody
   is running out of time. He must save himself and his friends as well as
   Elbay – the magnificent, terrifying, complicated city that he loves. Or
   darkness will fall on them all.
   [tapestry.jpg]
   The Tapestry of Fate by Shannon Chakraborty - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Amina al-Sirafi thinks she’s struck gold. Tasked with
   hunting down magical artifacts for the council of immortal peris, she
   can savour the occasional adventure on the high seas with her cherished
   criminal companions while still returning home to raise her beloved
   daughter.
   But when Raksh, the spirit of discord with whom she is reluctantly wed,
   provokes the council’s wrath, Amina is charged with a seemingly
   impossible quest: steal a spindle capable of rewriting fate from a
   mysterious sorceress on an island no one can escape.
   Forced to leave her daughter, Amina finds her mission almost
   immediately thrown into peril. But deadly storms, an erratic poison
   mistress, and old enemies are the least of her worries. For the peris’
   story is unravelling, hinting at a far deadlier game whose rules Amina
   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   Sister Svangerd and the Devil You Know by KJ Parker - May 26, 2026
   BLURB TO BE REVEALED LATER
   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.
   [rjb.jpg]
   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.
   [inkpot.jpg]
   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?
   [tinder.jpg]
   The Tinder Box by M R Carey - Jun 23, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a kingdom forgotten by history, a legend unfolds . .
   .
   Wounded in his county's endless wars, former soldier Mag Tresti finds
   work in the home of a reclusive widow, Jannae Mirchella. But Jannae is
   more than she seems. A witch of great skill and might, she hides her
   powers and her deep-laid plans behind a mask of harmless
   respectability.
   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and
   the witch are irrevocably intertwined. On the demon's body Mag finds a
   tinderbox - an artefact of terrifying magical power that can not only
   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.
   [harpy.jpg]
   The Harpy Knight by Sara Omer - Jul 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: With Bataar's campaign to conquer Dumakra victorious,
   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could
   tip everything into chaos.
   [Infinite+State.jpg]
   The Infinite State by Richard Swan - Aug 4, 2026
   Official Blurb: THE INFINITE STATE begins at a flashpoint in the lives
   of a widowed party member, a disgraced investigator, and a hypersled
   pilot—entangled in a plot to escape the suffocating authority of a
   fascist state.
   WHO GIVES YOU LIFE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Katherine Fuller’s husband is dead. As an esteemed member of Pater
   Aeternus—governing party of the fascist, galaxy-spanning Decurion
   Empire—he has left behind an estate of immeasurable wealth. And
   Katherine is going to inherit it.
   WHO GIVES YOU PURPOSE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Life under the Eternal Father is rigidly stratified, surveilled, and
   controlled—each new day to be endured, not lived. But with Katherine’s
   newfound fortune, she is presented with a rare and dangerous
   opportunity: purchase a virgin world, and create a better, fairer
   society.
   WHO GIVES YOU JOY?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   But the Empire cannot allow its wayward daughter to succeed. And as
   Katherine works in secret, recruiting allies she's not even sure she
   can trust, she will discover exactly how far Pater Aeternus is willing
   to go to stop her. Because Katherine is going to create something
   nobody has seen for many years.
   A democracy.
   [CTBR.jpg]
   The Dungeon Book by Gareth Hanrahan - Aug 11, 2026
   Official Blurb: Enter a world of dungeons and dragons, magic and
   manticores, and goblins and gargoyles . . .
   Bait doesn't remember a time before the dungeon. Before the dragon
   stole her from her cot. She doesn't know what her name was before she
   was handed over to the monstrous denizens of the dungeon beneath the
   sorcerer's tower. Luckily for Bait, they decided not to eat her. And so
   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful
   minotaur her protector, a sentient skull her tutor, and a blob of
   corridor slime her main source of nutrition.
   But the labyrinthine dungeon, with its haunted halls, buried temples
   and forgotten magics, draws treasure hunters like moths to flame. And
   as the outside world starts to intrude, Bait will learn what it means
   to be monstrous and she will have to decide where she truly belongs.
   [knave.jpg]
   The Knave and the Moon by Rachel Gillig - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: Aisling Cathedral is in ruins. Rodrick Myndacious,
   Bartholomew, and Maude Bauer are rumored to be dead—and the king has
   taken Sybil Delling as his bride. To show off their union and solidify
   his power over Traum, Benji proposes a series of tournaments throughout
   the hamlets. Captive and drugged, Sybil remains determined to vanquish
   him as she once did the Omens, even if she destroys the kingdom’s
   faith—and herself—in the process.
   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.
   [coming-soon.jpg]
   Blacktail by Scott Hawkins - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: The wolf Blacktail is faithful to his Forest God, but
   in these times, faith is not enough. His world is besieged by men. Soon
   his territory will be overrun, and then there will be nowhere left to
   go. When his mate, a house dog, is killed, Blacktail rebels. He invades
   the house of her owners, seeking vengeance.
   Blacktail’s fury catches the notice of an ancient and terrible feline
   witch, who makes an offer. What if Blacktail could end the human race
   responsible for the death of his family and for the destruction of the
   natural world, altogether? To do so, Blacktail must find and wake the
   Forest God. Only He might stand against the plague of men. Blacktail
   knows that his north woods are dwindling to nothing. He sees no other
   choice.
   As Blacktail journeys farther from his wild home and deeper into the
   world of man, he encounters strangers—animal, mortal, and
   otherworldly—who, for their own reasons, want to help Blacktail rid the
   world of humans. Along the way, it becomes clear that he is more than
   just a wolf. The Forest God is sleeping, yes. But what will be the
   price of waking him?
   [EXIT.jpg]
   Exit Party by Emily St. John Mendel - Sep 15, 2026
   Official Blurb: Los Angeles, 2031: The first spring after the collapse
   of the United States, peacekeeping troops withdraw from the city, the
   Jacaranda trees blossom, and the curfew is finally lifted. Ari Waker
   and her roommate pass the gauntlet of bomb-sniffing dogs, the shanty
   towns, and the Red Cross tents as they walk across Silverlake to a
   party. The mood is ecstatic inside the apartment, people drink and
   dance, a woman wears a silver dress, pleated like tinfoil. And then: A
   shift. A bewildered twin, an uncanny doppelganger stumbles through the
   crowd and out into the night, and Kareem, the party’s host, vanishes
   into thin air.
   As Ari Waker unravels the mystery of this inexplicable night, Emily St.
   John Mandel unfurls a story that takes us from a future America
   splintered by civil war to the seaside cliffs of Greece where weapons
   dealers hide in an elegant resort, and from the domed city of Paris to
   a colony on the moon. An unforgettable literary feat, Exit Party is a
   novel about the price of safety, the perils of the surveillance state,
   a requiem for a world not unlike our own, and a breathtaking story of
   resilience in the face of cataclysmic change.
   [coming-soon.jpg]
   Incarnate by Alma Katsu - Sep 22, 2026
   Official Blurb: Beauty doesn’t fade. It feeds.
   Marion Wagner has spent her whole life wanting nothing more than to be
   seen. But after failing to make her mark (any mark, really) as an
   influencer, she takes a job at a company focused on cutting-edge
   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her
   salvation.
   Isabella. An impossibly gorgeous girl who takes social media by storm.
   Marion’s code is brilliant, and Isabella seems real. So real that she
   garners millions of followers. Brands beg to partner with her. Everyone
   wants to meet her IRL. The adoration—and the cash—flows in. Marion is
   finally happy. She's getting all the attention she ever wanted—isn't
   she?
   Then the cracks begin to show. Marion can barely stay ahead of the
   partnership requests, and love letters and the rabid fans filling her
   DMs trying to track Isabella down. All this time working in secret with
   all this pressure is getting to Marion—she can’t tell where she ends,
   and her creation begins. And when someone gets a little too close to
   her secret, a violent confrontation sends Marion on the run, forcing
   her to confront what she’s willing to sacrifice to keep her secrets.
   [nightjars.jpg]
   Nightjars by Michael Wehunt - Sep 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: One rainy night on a first date, Luke Oshel’s new crush
   never comes back from the restroom. But she leaves an old photograph
   under her napkin―Luke as a child, a dead body in the shadows of his
   bedroom, and a terrifying masked man. He has no recollection of this
   event.
   Then more photos disrupt his life���Luke posing with murder victims,
   covered in blood―and he falls back into the deep paranoia and repressed
   memories he’s tried to leave behind. All the drugs and alcohol,
   therapy, and hypnosis sessions have never conquered his deepest
   fear��that he hasn'''t escaped the hidden legacy of his father, who
   killed his victims by exsanguination before his own death. But now
   there is a new string of serial killings, and the evidence all points
   to Luke.
   As his journey to uncover the truth unfolds in the North Georgia
   Appalachians, a threat arises that will risk everything he holds close,
   including his ex-wife and their young daughter. Now Luke must chase his
   father’s darkness through a centuries-old secret and learn what
   monsters truly are. And decide if he’s one of them.

   The Scarlet Ball by Nghi Vo - Oct 6, 2026
   Official Blurb: Judith Ban – convent girl, courtesan, and failed thief
   – is looking for her next identity. She’s no stranger to wealth or
   danger, but the glitter of New York’s Gilded Age hides a darkness even
   she has never imagined. Here, the city’s elite maintain their grip
   through opulent balls, whispered rituals, and marriages with demons
   hungry for human devotion.
   When she crosses paths with the formidable matriarch of the Howard
   family, Judith is offered an irresistible bargain: to take the place of
   a missing debutante in the coming season. With Miss Iphigenia
   Marshall’s face stitched over her own, Judith becomes white, rich, and
   ready to risk it all. If she can hold onto her charm, her wits, and her
   life, her reward will be a husband with undreamt-of power.
   But in a world ruled by appetite and ambition, the most dangerous
   hunger of all might be her own.

   Ard. This fast-moving adventure follows bandit and chieftain Flann
   Alderwood - a mythic, swashbuckling figure whose name is whispered

   kingdom menaced by dark sorcery and war.
   With the old King of Hernystir's health failing, warlords carve up the
   land and rival factions clash over the rightful heir. Into this chaos
   steps Flann, joined by allies both noble and common, to help the King's
   one legitimate heir claim his father's blessing and restore stability.
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to

   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.

   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?
   [trust.jpg]
   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.
   [RedWinter_dust-jacket-1.jpg]
   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.
   [THE-MISHEARD-WORLD_.jpg]
   The Misheard World by Aliya Whiteley - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Before wars are won, they must be witnessed.
   Elize Janview is a soldier, one of the few survivors of an unimaginably
   terrible weapon, which ended the long détente between the North and the
   South and plunged them back into all-out war. She enlisted with a dream
   of finding those responsible, of somehow getting revenge for the deaths
   of everyone she knew, but was posted to guard the prison at Crag, the
   fortress of the South, which has never fallen to the enemy.
   Janview’s life is transformed when a rough wooden box is delivered to
   Crag, holding the performer and spy Marius Mondegreen, agent of the
   North: the Misheard Word, who can read minds, breathe fire, and make
   objects appear and disappear. Janview is to witness Mondegreen’s
   interrogation by his captor, the beautiful and cruel Allynx Syld, who
   promises the end of the war. As recorder – and by degrees participant –
   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew
   about the war, and the very world she lives in…
   [Screen-Shot-2025-10-11-at-10.58.02-AM.jpg]
   The Library of Amorlin by Kalyn J0sephson - Mar 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: Kasira used to be a masterful con artist: choosing her
   target, building trust, judging the precise moment to make her move.
   Now, she’s working off a lengthy prison sentence by hunting dangerous
   magical creatures on behalf of the fanatical kingdom of Kalthos.
   But Kasira’s past catches up to her when the ambassador from Kalthos
   arrives at her camp with a deal: her freedom in exchange for
   infiltrating and destabilizing the magical institution meant to protect
   all six kingdoms—the Library of Amorlin.
   When Kasira assumes the role of the new Assistant Librarian, she enters
   an enchanting world brimming with books and beasts, tempting her with a
   life she can never have. But Kasira’s real future depends on her long
   con to bring down the Librarian. Unfortunately, Allaster is as prickly
   as he is handsome, and his monstrous secrets are about to catch up with
   them both . . .
   [9781835411384.tiff]
   Entwined by H. M. Long - Mar 10, 2026
   Official Blurb: Ottilie Rushforth hides from the mighty Sorcerer’s
   Guild as secretary to a has-been detective. She is Entwined – threads
   of magic run beneath her skin, and the Guild would trap her in service.
   But Ottilie has a plan to escape the Guild forever with her estranged
   fiancé, the enigmatic poet, soldier and smuggler Lewis Illing. All she
   must do is track down a mysterious artefact, claim the bounty, and
   leave the city forever. But Ottilie's sisters – Pretoria, a
   quick-witted sorceress and thief recently emerged from exile, and
   Madge, a guild mage to the core, appear to make equally unwelcome
   offers. A new life at the cost of everything she has ever wanted, or
   prestige and safety in a gilded cage.
   With her life on the line, Ottilie must track down the artifact in a
   city torn apart by prejudice and violence, and choose between the two
   sides of herself – the fugitive and the Entwined.
   [aicha.jpg]
   Aicha by Soraya Bouazzoui - Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: The Portuguese empire has planted its flag across
   Morocco, ruling with an iron fist. But eventually, all empires must
   fall.
   Aicha, the daughter of a Moroccan freedom-fighter, was born for battle.
   She has witnessed the death of her people, their starvation and torture
   at the hands of the occupiers, and it has awakened an anger within her.
   An anger that burns hot and bright and that speaks to Aicha’s soul.
   Only Aicha’s secret lover, Rachid, a rebellion leader, knows how to
   soothe her. But as the fight for Morocco’s freedom reaches its violent
   climax, the creature that simmers beneath Aicha’s skin begs to be
   unleashed. It hungers for the screams of those who have caused her
   pain, and it will not be ignored.
   [daughter.jpg]
   Daughter Of Crows by Mark Lawrence -  Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Set a thief to catch a thief. Set a monster to punish
   monsters.
   The Academy of Kindness exists to create agents of retribution, cast in
   the image of the Furies—known as the kindly ones—against whom even the
   gods hesitate to stand. Each year a hundred girls are sold to the
   Academy. Ten years later only three will emerge.
   The Academy’s halls run with blood. The few that survive its
   decade-long nightmare have been forged on the sands of the Wound
   Garden. They have learned ancient secrets amid the necrotic fumes of
   the Bone Garden. They leave its gates as avatars of vengeance, bound to
   uphold the oldest of laws.
   Only the most desperate would sell their child to the Kindnesses. But
   Rue … she sold herself. And now, a lifetime later, a long and bloody
   lifetime later, just as she has discovered peace, war has been brought
   to an old woman’s doorstep.

   This Kingdom Will Not Kill Me by Ilona Andrews - Mar 31, 2026
   Official Blurb: When Maggie wakes up cold, filthy, and naked in a
   gutter, it doesn't take her long to recognize Kair Toren, a city she
   knows intimately from the pages of the famously unfinished dark fantasy
   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,
   magic, and mayhem? Her encyclopedic knowledge of the plot, the setting,
   and the characters' ambitions and fates. But while she quickly
   discovers she cannot be killed (though many will try!), the same cannot
   be said for the living, breathing characters she's coming to love―a
   motley band that includes a former lady’s maid, a deadly assassin,
   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.
   Soon, instead of trying to get home, she finds herself enmeshed in the
   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all
   while trying to save them and the kingdom of Rellas from the way she
   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.

   The true horror of the Great Silence has been revealed. As nation after
   nation succumbs to the mind-plague and Sova scrambles to enlist help
   from across the globe, Ambassador Renata Rainer has been given a simple
   task: save the world. While she travels to the Principality of Casimir

   ancient answers—and finally confront the terrible fate that awaits him.

   In their wake, a task force of engineers, soldiers, and arcane experts
   will try and unpick the final secrets of the Great Silence—on both
   sides of the mortal plane. But time is running out. Count Lamprecht von
   Oldenburg has returned to the capital, armed with a terrible vision and
   enough madness to see it through. Those who stand in his way face a
   simple choice: join the revolution, or die.

   As the world tips towards chaos, all paths converge on the Eye of the
   Sea, where the fabric of reality wears thin—and where the Empire of the
   Wolf must confront the most terrible enemy it has ever known.

   losing war, three brothers desert their posts and begin a long, arduous

   exhausted—the brothers find a miracle deep in the dark woods. A home.
   Living in a remote cabin is a beautiful woman, Sarafina, and her young
   son, Titus. Sarafina takes the soldiers in, cares for them, feeds them,
   offers them a place to rest. But the youngest of the brothers is
   wary—something is not what it seems. After discovering a mysterious
   creek and a strange underground cavern, he gets a strong sense that the
   cabin, and the fertile land surrounding it, might be harboring
   something nefarious, terrifying, and dangerous.
   What ensues is a nightmare beyond imagination, an escalation of horrors
   that the brothers must somehow fight to survive. With tensions high,
   the country divided, and loyalties put to the test, Sarafina spotlights
   that Fracassi is a star of modern horror.

   Japanese Gothic by Kylie Lee Baker - Apr 21, 2026
   Official Blurb: October, 2026: Lee Turner doesn’t remember how or why
   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.
   October, 1877: Sen is a young samurai in exile, hiding from the
   imperial soldiers in a house behind the sword ferns. A monster came
   home from war wearing her father’s face, but Sen would do anything to
   please him, even turn her sword on her own mother. She knows the
   soldiers will soon slaughter her whole family when she sees a terrible
   omen: a young foreign man who appears outside her window.
   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   A River Red With Blood by John Connolly - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: The players call it the Game, and its aim is simple: to
   abduct and kill a stranger without getting caught. They're very good at

   Killing Outside the Game.
   But those rules have been broken.
   When the drowned body of a troubled teenager is recovered from a river
   in Maine's Kennebec Valley, and a young woman disappears from a small
   rural town, they draw the attention of the private investigator named
   Charlie Parker.
   Now Parker will be forced to confront a band of men without morality
   and without loyalty, not even to one another, in a place where the very
   darkness is alive.
   Because something has emerged from the shadows, something very bad. And
   it wants revenge.

   final mission, she can't refuse, especially when she realizes who lies

   corporate espionage and shadowy secrets, what she uncovers could
   forever change humanity's existence among the stars.

   the power to extend life or end it, and one woman in the twilight of
   her calling must decide what's ultimately worth living—or dying—for.

   Sisters of the Lizard by Jackson Ford - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: All Sayana wanted was to enjoy her life in the rolling
   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   Outlaw by Jim Butcher - May 12, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a city that’s just beginning to recover from the
   devastation caused by the Battle of Chicago, Harry Dresden is finally
   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .

   Mortedant's Peril by RJ Barker - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Irody can speak to the dead. But the living want him
   silenced.
   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the
   city’s guilds, nobles and villains all fixed on him.
   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a
   hulking, inhuman mercenary from the sea people’s city of Oknosuka. With
   danger and death lurking round every corner, and trust a luxury, Irody
   is running out of time. He must save himself and his friends as well as
   Elbay – the magnificent, terrifying, complicated city that he loves. Or
   darkness will fall on them all.

   hunting down magical artifacts for the council of immortal peris, she
   can savour the occasional adventure on the high seas with her cherished
   criminal companions while still returning home to raise her beloved
   daughter.
   But when Raksh, the spirit of discord with whom she is reluctantly wed,
   provokes the council’s wrath, Amina is charged with a seemingly
   impossible quest: steal a spindle capable of rewriting fate from a
   mysterious sorceress on an island no one can escape.
   Forced to leave her daughter, Amina finds her mission almost
   immediately thrown into peril. But deadly storms, an erratic poison
   mistress, and old enemies are the least of her worries. For the peris’
   story is unravelling, hinting at a far deadlier game whose rules Amina
   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   BLURB TO BE REVEALED LATER
   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.

   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.

   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?

   Wounded in his county's endless wars, former soldier Mag Tresti finds

   respectability.
   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and
   the witch are irrevocably intertwined. On the demon's body Mag finds a
   tinderbox - an artefact of terrifying magical power that can not only
   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.

   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could
   tip everything into chaos.

   was handed over to the monstrous denizens of the dungeon beneath the
   sorcerer's tower. Luckily for Bait, they decided not to eat her. And so
   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful

   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.

   Marion Wagner has spent her whole life wanting nothing more than to be
   seen. But after failing to make her mark (any mark, really) as an
   influencer, she takes a job at a company focused on cutting-edge
   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her
   salvation.
   Isabella. An impossibly gorgeous girl who takes social media by storm.
   Marion’s code is brilliant, and Isabella seems real. So real that she
   garners millions of followers. Brands beg to partner with her. Everyone
   wants to meet her IRL. The adoration—and the cash—flows in. Marion is
   finally happy. She's getting all the attention she ever wanted—isn't
   she?
   Then the cracks begin to show. Marion can barely stay ahead of the
   partnership requests, and love letters and the rabid fans filling her
   DMs trying to track Isabella down. All this time working in secret with
   all this pressure is getting to Marion—she can’t tell where she ends,
   and her creation begins. And when someone gets a little too close to
   her secret, a violent confrontation sends Marion on the run, forcing
   her to confront what she’s willing to sacrifice to keep her secrets.

   Nightjars by Michael Wehunt - Sep 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: One rainy night on a first date, Luke Oshel’s new crush
   never comes back from the restroom. But she leaves an old photograph
   under her napkin―Luke as a child, a dead body in the shadows of his
   bedroom, and a terrifying masked man. He has no recollection of this
   event.
   Then more photos disrupt his life���Luke posing with murder victims,
   covered in blood―and he falls back into the deep paranoia and repressed
   memories he’s tried to leave behind. All the drugs and alcohol,
   therapy, and hypnosis sessions have never conquered his deepest
   fear��that he hasn'''t escaped the hidden legacy of his father, who
   killed his victims by exsanguination before his own death. But now
   there is a new string of serial killings, and the evidence all points
   to Luke.
   As his journey to uncover the truth unfolds in the North Georgia
   Appalachians, a threat arises that will risk everything he holds close,
   including his ex-wife and their young daughter. Now Luke must chase his
   father’s darkness through a centuries-old secret and learn what
   monsters truly are. And decide if he’s one of them.

   The Scarlet Ball by Nghi Vo - Oct 6, 2026
   Official Blurb: Judith Ban – convent girl, courtesan, and failed thief
   – is looking for her next identity. She’s no stranger to wealth or
   danger, but the glitter of New York’s Gilded Age hides a darkness even
   she has never imagined. Here, the city’s elite maintain their grip
   through opulent balls, whispered rituals, and marriages with demons
   hungry for human devotion.
   When she crosses paths with the formidable matriarch of the Howard
   family, Judith is offered an irresistible bargain: to take the place of
   a missing debutante in the coming season. With Miss Iphigenia
   Marshall’s face stitched over her own, Judith becomes white, rich, and
   ready to risk it all. If she can hold onto her charm, her wits, and her
   life, her reward will be a husband with undreamt-of power.
   But in a world ruled by appetite and ambition, the most dangerous
   hunger of all might be her own.

   The Splintered Sun by Tad Williams - Oct 6, 2026
   Unofficial Summary: From the much-loved, Sunday Times bestselling
   author comes a thrilling new tale set in the legendary world of Osten
   Ard. This fast-moving adventure follows bandit and chieftain Flann
   Alderwood - a mythic, swashbuckling figure whose name is whispered
   across the realm-and his band of misfit rebels as they navigate a
   kingdom menaced by dark sorcery and war.
   With the old King of Hernystir's health failing, warlords carve up the
   land and rival factions clash over the rightful heir. Into this chaos
   steps Flann, joined by allies both noble and common, to help the King's
   one legitimate heir claim his father's blessing and restore stability.
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to
   end Flann's quest before it begins.
   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.

   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of

   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.

   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.

   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?

   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.

   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.

   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew

   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.

   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all
   while trying to save them and the kingdom of Rellas from the way she
   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.

   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.

   imperial soldiers in a house behind the sword ferns. A monster came

   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If

   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .

   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those

   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is

   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   Sister Svangerd and the Devil You Know by KJ Parker - May 26, 2026
   BLURB TO BE REVEALED LATER
   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.

   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.

   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?
   [tinder.jpg]
   The Tinder Box by M R Carey - Jun 23, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a kingdom forgotten by history, a legend unfolds . .
   .
   Wounded in his county's endless wars, former soldier Mag Tresti finds
   work in the home of a reclusive widow, Jannae Mirchella. But Jannae is
   more than she seems. A witch of great skill and might, she hides her
   powers and her deep-laid plans behind a mask of harmless
   respectability.
   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and
   the witch are irrevocably intertwined. On the demon's body Mag finds a
   tinderbox - an artefact of terrifying magical power that can not only
   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.
   [harpy.jpg]
   The Harpy Knight by Sara Omer - Jul 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: With Bataar's campaign to conquer Dumakra victorious,
   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could
   tip everything into chaos.
   [Infinite+State.jpg]
   The Infinite State by Richard Swan - Aug 4, 2026
   Official Blurb: THE INFINITE STATE begins at a flashpoint in the lives
   of a widowed party member, a disgraced investigator, and a hypersled
   pilot—entangled in a plot to escape the suffocating authority of a
   fascist state.
   WHO GIVES YOU LIFE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Katherine Fuller’s husband is dead. As an esteemed member of Pater
   Aeternus—governing party of the fascist, galaxy-spanning Decurion
   Empire—he has left behind an estate of immeasurable wealth. And
   Katherine is going to inherit it.
   WHO GIVES YOU PURPOSE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Life under the Eternal Father is rigidly stratified, surveilled, and
   controlled—each new day to be endured, not lived. But with Katherine’s
   newfound fortune, she is presented with a rare and dangerous
   opportunity: purchase a virgin world, and create a better, fairer
   society.
   WHO GIVES YOU JOY?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   But the Empire cannot allow its wayward daughter to succeed. And as
   Katherine works in secret, recruiting allies she's not even sure she
   can trust, she will discover exactly how far Pater Aeternus is willing
   to go to stop her. Because Katherine is going to create something
   nobody has seen for many years.
   A democracy.
   [CTBR.jpg]
   The Dungeon Book by Gareth Hanrahan - Aug 11, 2026
   Official Blurb: Enter a world of dungeons and dragons, magic and
   manticores, and goblins and gargoyles . . .
   Bait doesn't remember a time before the dungeon. Before the dragon
   stole her from her cot. She doesn't know what her name was before she
   was handed over to the monstrous denizens of the dungeon beneath the
   sorcerer's tower. Luckily for Bait, they decided not to eat her. And so
   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful
   minotaur her protector, a sentient skull her tutor, and a blob of
   corridor slime her main source of nutrition.
   But the labyrinthine dungeon, with its haunted halls, buried temples
   and forgotten magics, draws treasure hunters like moths to flame. And
   as the outside world starts to intrude, Bait will learn what it means
   to be monstrous and she will have to decide where she truly belongs.
   [knave.jpg]
   The Knave and the Moon by Rachel Gillig - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: Aisling Cathedral is in ruins. Rodrick Myndacious,
   Bartholomew, and Maude Bauer are rumored to be dead—and the king has
   taken Sybil Delling as his bride. To show off their union and solidify
   his power over Traum, Benji proposes a series of tournaments throughout
   the hamlets. Captive and drugged, Sybil remains determined to vanquish
   him as she once did the Omens, even if she destroys the kingdom’s
   faith—and herself—in the process.
   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.
   [coming-soon.jpg]
   Blacktail by Scott Hawkins - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: The wolf Blacktail is faithful to his Forest God, but
   in these times, faith is not enough. His world is besieged by men. Soon
   his territory will be overrun, and then there will be nowhere left to
   go. When his mate, a house dog, is killed, Blacktail rebels. He invades
   the house of her owners, seeking vengeance.
   Blacktail’s fury catches the notice of an ancient and terrible feline
   witch, who makes an offer. What if Blacktail could end the human race
   responsible for the death of his family and for the destruction of the
   natural world, altogether? To do so, Blacktail must find and wake the
   Forest God. Only He might stand against the plague of men. Blacktail
   knows that his north woods are dwindling to nothing. He sees no other
   choice.
   As Blacktail journeys farther from his wild home and deeper into the
   world of man, he encounters strangers—animal, mortal, and
   otherworldly—who, for their own reasons, want to help Blacktail rid the
   world of humans. Along the way, it becomes clear that he is more than
   just a wolf. The Forest God is sleeping, yes. But what will be the
   price of waking him?
   [EXIT.jpg]
   Exit Party by Emily St. John Mendel - Sep 15, 2026
   Official Blurb: Los Angeles, 2031: The first spring after the collapse
   of the United States, peacekeeping troops withdraw from the city, the
   Jacaranda trees blossom, and the curfew is finally lifted. Ari Waker
   and her roommate pass the gauntlet of bomb-sniffing dogs, the shanty
   towns, and the Red Cross tents as they walk across Silverlake to a
   party. The mood is ecstatic inside the apartment, people drink and
   dance, a woman wears a silver dress, pleated like tinfoil. And then: A
   shift. A bewildered twin, an uncanny doppelganger stumbles through the
   crowd and out into the night, and Kareem, the party’s host, vanishes
   into thin air.
   As Ari Waker unravels the mystery of this inexplicable night, Emily St.
   John Mandel unfurls a story that takes us from a future America
   splintered by civil war to the seaside cliffs of Greece where weapons
   dealers hide in an elegant resort, and from the domed city of Paris to
   a colony on the moon. An unforgettable literary feat, Exit Party is a
   novel about the price of safety, the perils of the surveillance state,
   a requiem for a world not unlike our own, and a breathtaking story of
   resilience in the face of cataclysmic change.
   [coming-soon.jpg]
   Incarnate by Alma Katsu - Sep 22, 2026
   Official Blurb: Beauty doesn’t fade. It feeds.
   Marion Wagner has spent her whole life wanting nothing more than to be
   seen. But after failing to make her mark (any mark, really) as an
   influencer, she takes a job at a company focused on cutting-edge
   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her
   salvation.
   Isabella. An impossibly gorgeous girl who takes social media by storm.
   Marion’s code is brilliant, and Isabella seems real. So real that she
   garners millions of followers. Brands beg to partner with her. Everyone
   wants to meet her IRL. The adoration—and the cash—flows in. Marion is
   finally happy. She's getting all the attention she ever wanted—isn't
   she?
   Then the cracks begin to show. Marion can barely stay ahead of the
   partnership requests, and love letters and the rabid fans filling her
   DMs trying to track Isabella down. All this time working in secret with
   all this pressure is getting to Marion—she can’t tell where she ends,
   and her creation begins. And when someone gets a little too close to
   her secret, a violent confrontation sends Marion on the run, forcing
   her to confront what she’s willing to sacrifice to keep her secrets.
   [nightjars.jpg]
   Nightjars by Michael Wehunt - Sep 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: One rainy night on a first date, Luke Oshel’s new crush
   never comes back from the restroom. But she leaves an old photograph
   under her napkin―Luke as a child, a dead body in the shadows of his
   bedroom, and a terrifying masked man. He has no recollection of this
   event.
   Then more photos disrupt his life���Luke posing with murder victims,
   covered in blood―and he falls back into the deep paranoia and repressed
   memories he’s tried to leave behind. All the drugs and alcohol,
   therapy, and hypnosis sessions have never conquered his deepest
   fear��that he hasn'''t escaped the hidden legacy of his father, who
   killed his victims by exsanguination before his own death. But now
   there is a new string of serial killings, and the evidence all points
   to Luke.
   As his journey to uncover the truth unfolds in the North Georgia
   Appalachians, a threat arises that will risk everything he holds close,
   including his ex-wife and their young daughter. Now Luke must chase his
   father’s darkness through a centuries-old secret and learn what
   monsters truly are. And decide if he’s one of them.
   [scarlett.jpg]
   The Scarlet Ball by Nghi Vo - Oct 6, 2026
   Official Blurb: Judith Ban – convent girl, courtesan, and failed thief
   – is looking for her next identity. She’s no stranger to wealth or
   danger, but the glitter of New York’s Gilded Age hides a darkness even
   she has never imagined. Here, the city’s elite maintain their grip
   through opulent balls, whispered rituals, and marriages with demons
   hungry for human devotion.
   When she crosses paths with the formidable matriarch of the Howard
   family, Judith is offered an irresistible bargain: to take the place of
   a missing debutante in the coming season. With Miss Iphigenia
   Marshall’s face stitched over her own, Judith becomes white, rich, and
   ready to risk it all. If she can hold onto her charm, her wits, and her
   life, her reward will be a husband with undreamt-of power.
   But in a world ruled by appetite and ambition, the most dangerous
   hunger of all might be her own.

   The Splintered Sun by Tad Williams - Oct 6, 2026
   Unofficial Summary: From the much-loved, Sunday Times bestselling
   author comes a thrilling new tale set in the legendary world of Osten
   Ard. This fast-moving adventure follows bandit and chieftain Flann
   Alderwood - a mythic, swashbuckling figure whose name is whispered
   across the realm-and his band of misfit rebels as they navigate a
   kingdom menaced by dark sorcery and war.
   With the old King of Hernystir's health failing, warlords carve up the
   land and rival factions clash over the rightful heir. Into this chaos
   steps Flann, joined by allies both noble and common, to help the King's
   one legitimate heir claim his father's blessing and restore stability.
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to
   end Flann's quest before it begins.
   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.
   [thrice%20bound.jpg]
   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?
   [trust.jpg]
   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.
   [RedWinter_dust-jacket-1.jpg]
   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.
   [THE-MISHEARD-WORLD_.jpg]
   The Misheard World by Aliya Whiteley - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Before wars are won, they must be witnessed.
   Elize Janview is a soldier, one of the few survivors of an unimaginably
   terrible weapon, which ended the long détente between the North and the
   South and plunged them back into all-out war. She enlisted with a dream
   of finding those responsible, of somehow getting revenge for the deaths
   of everyone she knew, but was posted to guard the prison at Crag, the
   fortress of the South, which has never fallen to the enemy.
   Janview’s life is transformed when a rough wooden box is delivered to
   Crag, holding the performer and spy Marius Mondegreen, agent of the
   North: the Misheard Word, who can read minds, breathe fire, and make
   objects appear and disappear. Janview is to witness Mondegreen’s
   interrogation by his captor, the beautiful and cruel Allynx Syld, who
   promises the end of the war. As recorder – and by degrees participant –
   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew
   about the war, and the very world she lives in…
   [Screen-Shot-2025-10-11-at-10.58.02-AM.jpg]
   The Library of Amorlin by Kalyn J0sephson - Mar 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: Kasira used to be a masterful con artist: choosing her
   target, building trust, judging the precise moment to make her move.
   Now, she’s working off a lengthy prison sentence by hunting dangerous
   magical creatures on behalf of the fanatical kingdom of Kalthos.
   But Kasira’s past catches up to her when the ambassador from Kalthos
   arrives at her camp with a deal: her freedom in exchange for
   infiltrating and destabilizing the magical institution meant to protect
   all six kingdoms—the Library of Amorlin.
   When Kasira assumes the role of the new Assistant Librarian, she enters
   an enchanting world brimming with books and beasts, tempting her with a
   life she can never have. But Kasira’s real future depends on her long
   con to bring down the Librarian. Unfortunately, Allaster is as prickly
   as he is handsome, and his monstrous secrets are about to catch up with
   them both . . .
   [9781835411384.tiff]
   Entwined by H. M. Long - Mar 10, 2026
   Official Blurb: Ottilie Rushforth hides from the mighty Sorcerer’s
   Guild as secretary to a has-been detective. She is Entwined – threads
   of magic run beneath her skin, and the Guild would trap her in service.
   But Ottilie has a plan to escape the Guild forever with her estranged
   fiancé, the enigmatic poet, soldier and smuggler Lewis Illing. All she
   must do is track down a mysterious artefact, claim the bounty, and
   leave the city forever. But Ottilie's sisters – Pretoria, a
   quick-witted sorceress and thief recently emerged from exile, and
   Madge, a guild mage to the core, appear to make equally unwelcome
   offers. A new life at the cost of everything she has ever wanted, or
   prestige and safety in a gilded cage.
   With her life on the line, Ottilie must track down the artifact in a
   city torn apart by prejudice and violence, and choose between the two
   sides of herself – the fugitive and the Entwined.
   [aicha.jpg]
   Aicha by Soraya Bouazzoui - Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: The Portuguese empire has planted its flag across
   Morocco, ruling with an iron fist. But eventually, all empires must
   fall.
   Aicha, the daughter of a Moroccan freedom-fighter, was born for battle.
   She has witnessed the death of her people, their starvation and torture
   at the hands of the occupiers, and it has awakened an anger within her.
   An anger that burns hot and bright and that speaks to Aicha’s soul.
   Only Aicha’s secret lover, Rachid, a rebellion leader, knows how to
   soothe her. But as the fight for Morocco’s freedom reaches its violent
   climax, the creature that simmers beneath Aicha’s skin begs to be
   unleashed. It hungers for the screams of those who have caused her
   pain, and it will not be ignored.
   [daughter.jpg]
   Daughter Of Crows by Mark Lawrence -  Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Set a thief to catch a thief. Set a monster to punish
   monsters.
   The Academy of Kindness exists to create agents of retribution, cast in
   the image of the Furies—known as the kindly ones—against whom even the
   gods hesitate to stand. Each year a hundred girls are sold to the
   Academy. Ten years later only three will emerge.
   The Academy’s halls run with blood. The few that survive its
   decade-long nightmare have been forged on the sands of the Wound
   Garden. They have learned ancient secrets amid the necrotic fumes of
   the Bone Garden. They leave its gates as avatars of vengeance, bound to
   uphold the oldest of laws.
   Only the most desperate would sell their child to the Kindnesses. But
   Rue … she sold herself. And now, a lifetime later, a long and bloody
   lifetime later, just as she has discovered peace, war has been brought
   to an old woman’s doorstep.
   That was a mistake.
   [Kingdom.jpg]
   This Kingdom Will Not Kill Me by Ilona Andrews - Mar 31, 2026
   Official Blurb: When Maggie wakes up cold, filthy, and naked in a
   gutter, it doesn't take her long to recognize Kair Toren, a city she
   knows intimately from the pages of the famously unfinished dark fantasy
   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,
   magic, and mayhem? Her encyclopedic knowledge of the plot, the setting,
   and the characters' ambitions and fates. But while she quickly
   discovers she cannot be killed (though many will try!), the same cannot
   be said for the living, breathing characters she's coming to love―a
   motley band that includes a former lady’s maid, a deadly assassin,
   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.
   Soon, instead of trying to get home, she finds herself enmeshed in the
   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all
   while trying to save them and the kingdom of Rellas from the way she
   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.
   [sttel%20gods.jpg]

   Looms. And the Empire of the Wolf teeters on the brink.

   The true horror of the Great Silence has been revealed. As nation after
   nation succumbs to the mind-plague and Sova scrambles to enlist help
   from across the globe, Ambassador Renata Rainer has been given a simple
   task: save the world. While she travels to the Principality of Casimir
   to enlist the help of the Empire’s oldest enemy, Lieutenant Peter
   Kleist returns to the haunted forests of the New East to search for
   ancient answers—and finally confront the terrible fate that awaits him.

   In their wake, a task force of engineers, soldiers, and arcane experts
   will try and unpick the final secrets of the Great Silence—on both
   sides of the mortal plane. But time is running out. Count Lamprecht von
   Oldenburg has returned to the capital, armed with a terrible vision and
   enough madness to see it through. Those who stand in his way face a
   simple choice: join the revolution, or die.

   As the world tips towards chaos, all paths converge on the Eye of the
   Sea, where the fabric of reality wears thin—and where the Empire of the
   Wolf must confront the most terrible enemy it has ever known.

   prepared for the long-buried secrets he will find.

   [Sarafina_Cover.jpg]
   Sarafina by Philip Fracassi - Apr 7, 2026
   Official Blurb: Choosing to risk execution rather than be killed in a
   losing war, three brothers desert their posts and begin a long, arduous
   journey back home. After weeks of dealing with rough terrain while
   evading bandits and home guard soldiers—starving, injured, and
   exhausted—the brothers find a miracle deep in the dark woods. A home.
   Living in a remote cabin is a beautiful woman, Sarafina, and her young
   son, Titus. Sarafina takes the soldiers in, cares for them, feeds them,
   offers them a place to rest. But the youngest of the brothers is
   wary—something is not what it seems. After discovering a mysterious
   creek and a strange underground cavern, he gets a strong sense that the
   cabin, and the fertile land surrounding it, might be harboring
   something nefarious, terrifying, and dangerous.
   What ensues is a nightmare beyond imagination, an escalation of horrors
   that the brothers must somehow fight to survive. With tensions high,
   the country divided, and loyalties put to the test, Sarafina spotlights
   that Fracassi is a star of modern horror.

   home of the gods? Could they go and beg them to stop the war?
   They will need help, but as more folk get involved in their blasphemous
   plot, can they keep it under wraps? Can magic get them to the moon? Or
   will their heresy lead them to the gallows?

   Japanese Gothic by Kylie Lee Baker - Apr 21, 2026
   Official Blurb: October, 2026: Lee Turner doesn’t remember how or why
   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.
   October, 1877: Sen is a young samurai in exile, hiding from the
   imperial soldiers in a house behind the sword ferns. A monster came
   home from war wearing her father’s face, but Sen would do anything to
   please him, even turn her sword on her own mother. She knows the
   soldiers will soon slaughter her whole family when she sees a terrible
   omen: a young foreign man who appears outside her window.
   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   A River Red With Blood by John Connolly - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: The players call it the Game, and its aim is simple: to
   abduct and kill a stranger without getting caught. They're very good at
   it. They've been playing it for a long time. And they can keep playing
   so long as everyone stick to the rules: No Killing Close to Home and No
   Killing Outside the Game.
   But those rules have been broken.
   When the drowned body of a troubled teenager is recovered from a river
   in Maine's Kennebec Valley, and a young woman disappears from a small
   rural town, they draw the attention of the private investigator named
   Charlie Parker.
   Now Parker will be forced to confront a band of men without morality
   and without loyalty, not even to one another, in a place where the very
   darkness is alive.
   Because something has emerged from the shadows, something very bad. And
   it wants revenge.

   Isako is a legendary swordswoman, but every legend must come to an end.
   When her long-time client unexpectedly retires, she plans to follow—to
   walk out into the frozen wasteland of their planet with her head held
   high and her family enriched by her death. But when she's offered a
   final mission, she can't refuse, especially when she realizes who lies
   at the center of it all: Martim, her last—and worst—apprentice, who's
   somehow made his way to the top. As she's thrust into a world of
   corporate espionage and shadowy secrets, what she uncovers could
   forever change humanity's existence among the stars.
   The Last Contract of Isako is epic science fiction like only Fonda Lee

   the power to extend life or end it, and one woman in the twilight of
   her calling must decide what's ultimately worth living—or dying—for.

   Sisters of the Lizard by Jackson Ford - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: All Sayana wanted was to enjoy her life in the rolling
   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   Outlaw by Jim Butcher - May 12, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a city that’s just beginning to recover from the
   devastation caused by the Battle of Chicago, Harry Dresden is finally
   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .

   Mortedant's Peril by RJ Barker - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Irody can speak to the dead. But the living want him
   silenced.
   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the
   city’s guilds, nobles and villains all fixed on him.
   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a
   hulking, inhuman mercenary from the sea people’s city of Oknosuka. With
   danger and death lurking round every corner, and trust a luxury, Irody
   is running out of time. He must save himself and his friends as well as
   Elbay – the magnificent, terrifying, complicated city that he loves. Or
   darkness will fall on them all.

   hunting down magical artifacts for the council of immortal peris, she
   can savour the occasional adventure on the high seas with her cherished
   criminal companions while still returning home to raise her beloved

   impossible quest: steal a spindle capable of rewriting fate from a
   mysterious sorceress on an island no one can escape.
   Forced to leave her daughter, Amina finds her mission almost
   immediately thrown into peril. But deadly storms, an erratic poison
   mistress, and old enemies are the least of her worries. For the peris’
   story is unravelling, hinting at a far deadlier game whose rules Amina
   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   BLURB TO BE REVEALED LATER
   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.

   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.

   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?

   .
   Wounded in his county's endless wars, former soldier Mag Tresti finds
   work in the home of a reclusive widow, Jannae Mirchella. But Jannae is
   more than she seems. A witch of great skill and might, she hides her
   powers and her deep-laid plans behind a mask of harmless
   respectability.
   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and
   the witch are irrevocably intertwined. On the demon's body Mag finds a
   tinderbox - an artefact of terrifying magical power that can not only
   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.

   Official Blurb: With Bataar's campaign to conquer Dumakra victorious,
   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could
   tip everything into chaos.

   one legitimate heir claim his father's blessing and restore stability.
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to
   end Flann's quest before it begins.
   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.

   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.

   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.

   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.

   promises the end of the war. As recorder – and by degrees participant –
   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew
   about the war, and the very world she lives in…

   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,

   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.

   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,

   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid

   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he

   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the

   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a

   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.

   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.

   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?

   The Tinder Box by M R Carey - Jun 23, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a kingdom forgotten by history, a legend unfolds . .
   .
   Wounded in his county's endless wars, former soldier Mag Tresti finds
   work in the home of a reclusive widow, Jannae Mirchella. But Jannae is
   more than she seems. A witch of great skill and might, she hides her
   powers and her deep-laid plans behind a mask of harmless
   respectability.
   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and
   the witch are irrevocably intertwined. On the demon's body Mag finds a
   tinderbox - an artefact of terrifying magical power that can not only
   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.

   The Harpy Knight by Sara Omer - Jul 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: With Bataar's campaign to conquer Dumakra victorious,
   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could
   tip everything into chaos.
   [Infinite+State.jpg]
   The Infinite State by Richard Swan - Aug 4, 2026
   Official Blurb: THE INFINITE STATE begins at a flashpoint in the lives
   of a widowed party member, a disgraced investigator, and a hypersled
   pilot—entangled in a plot to escape the suffocating authority of a
   fascist state.
   WHO GIVES YOU LIFE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Katherine Fuller’s husband is dead. As an esteemed member of Pater
   Aeternus—governing party of the fascist, galaxy-spanning Decurion
   Empire—he has left behind an estate of immeasurable wealth. And
   Katherine is going to inherit it.
   WHO GIVES YOU PURPOSE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Life under the Eternal Father is rigidly stratified, surveilled, and
   controlled—each new day to be endured, not lived. But with Katherine’s
   newfound fortune, she is presented with a rare and dangerous
   opportunity: purchase a virgin world, and create a better, fairer
   society.
   WHO GIVES YOU JOY?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   But the Empire cannot allow its wayward daughter to succeed. And as
   Katherine works in secret, recruiting allies she's not even sure she
   can trust, she will discover exactly how far Pater Aeternus is willing
   to go to stop her. Because Katherine is going to create something
   nobody has seen for many years.
   A democracy.

   The Dungeon Book by Gareth Hanrahan - Aug 11, 2026
   Official Blurb: Enter a world of dungeons and dragons, magic and
   manticores, and goblins and gargoyles . . .
   Bait doesn't remember a time before the dungeon. Before the dragon
   stole her from her cot. She doesn't know what her name was before she
   was handed over to the monstrous denizens of the dungeon beneath the
   sorcerer's tower. Luckily for Bait, they decided not to eat her. And so
   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful
   minotaur her protector, a sentient skull her tutor, and a blob of
   corridor slime her main source of nutrition.
   But the labyrinthine dungeon, with its haunted halls, buried temples
   and forgotten magics, draws treasure hunters like moths to flame. And
   as the outside world starts to intrude, Bait will learn what it means
   to be monstrous and she will have to decide where she truly belongs.
   [knave.jpg]
   The Knave and the Moon by Rachel Gillig - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: Aisling Cathedral is in ruins. Rodrick Myndacious,
   Bartholomew, and Maude Bauer are rumored to be dead—and the king has
   taken Sybil Delling as his bride. To show off their union and solidify
   his power over Traum, Benji proposes a series of tournaments throughout
   the hamlets. Captive and drugged, Sybil remains determined to vanquish
   him as she once did the Omens, even if she destroys the kingdom’s
   faith—and herself—in the process.
   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.
   [coming-soon.jpg]
   Blacktail by Scott Hawkins - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: The wolf Blacktail is faithful to his Forest God, but
   in these times, faith is not enough. His world is besieged by men. Soon
   his territory will be overrun, and then there will be nowhere left to
   go. When his mate, a house dog, is killed, Blacktail rebels. He invades
   the house of her owners, seeking vengeance.
   Blacktail’s fury catches the notice of an ancient and terrible feline
   witch, who makes an offer. What if Blacktail could end the human race
   responsible for the death of his family and for the destruction of the
   natural world, altogether? To do so, Blacktail must find and wake the
   Forest God. Only He might stand against the plague of men. Blacktail
   knows that his north woods are dwindling to nothing. He sees no other
   choice.
   As Blacktail journeys farther from his wild home and deeper into the
   world of man, he encounters strangers—animal, mortal, and
   otherworldly—who, for their own reasons, want to help Blacktail rid the
   world of humans. Along the way, it becomes clear that he is more than
   just a wolf. The Forest God is sleeping, yes. But what will be the
   price of waking him?
   [EXIT.jpg]
   Exit Party by Emily St. John Mendel - Sep 15, 2026
   Official Blurb: Los Angeles, 2031: The first spring after the collapse
   of the United States, peacekeeping troops withdraw from the city, the
   Jacaranda trees blossom, and the curfew is finally lifted. Ari Waker
   and her roommate pass the gauntlet of bomb-sniffing dogs, the shanty
   towns, and the Red Cross tents as they walk across Silverlake to a
   party. The mood is ecstatic inside the apartment, people drink and
   dance, a woman wears a silver dress, pleated like tinfoil. And then: A
   shift. A bewildered twin, an uncanny doppelganger stumbles through the
   crowd and out into the night, and Kareem, the party’s host, vanishes
   into thin air.
   As Ari Waker unravels the mystery of this inexplicable night, Emily St.
   John Mandel unfurls a story that takes us from a future America
   splintered by civil war to the seaside cliffs of Greece where weapons
   dealers hide in an elegant resort, and from the domed city of Paris to
   a colony on the moon. An unforgettable literary feat, Exit Party is a
   novel about the price of safety, the perils of the surveillance state,
   a requiem for a world not unlike our own, and a breathtaking story of
   resilience in the face of cataclysmic change.

   Incarnate by Alma Katsu - Sep 22, 2026
   Official Blurb: Beauty doesn’t fade. It feeds.
   Marion Wagner has spent her whole life wanting nothing more than to be
   seen. But after failing to make her mark (any mark, really) as an
   influencer, she takes a job at a company focused on cutting-edge
   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her
   salvation.
   Isabella. An impossibly gorgeous girl who takes social media by storm.
   Marion’s code is brilliant, and Isabella seems real. So real that she
   garners millions of followers. Brands beg to partner with her. Everyone
   wants to meet her IRL. The adoration—and the cash—flows in. Marion is
   finally happy. She's getting all the attention she ever wanted—isn't
   she?
   Then the cracks begin to show. Marion can barely stay ahead of the
   partnership requests, and love letters and the rabid fans filling her
   DMs trying to track Isabella down. All this time working in secret with
   all this pressure is getting to Marion—she can’t tell where she ends,
   and her creation begins. And when someone gets a little too close to
   her secret, a violent confrontation sends Marion on the run, forcing
   her to confront what she’s willing to sacrifice to keep her secrets.
   [nightjars.jpg]
   Nightjars by Michael Wehunt - Sep 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: One rainy night on a first date, Luke Oshel’s new crush
   never comes back from the restroom. But she leaves an old photograph
   under her napkin―Luke as a child, a dead body in the shadows of his
   bedroom, and a terrifying masked man. He has no recollection of this
   event.
   Then more photos disrupt his life���Luke posing with murder victims,
   covered in blood―and he falls back into the deep paranoia and repressed
   memories he’s tried to leave behind. All the drugs and alcohol,
   therapy, and hypnosis sessions have never conquered his deepest
   fear��that he hasn'''t escaped the hidden legacy of his father, who
   killed his victims by exsanguination before his own death. But now
   there is a new string of serial killings, and the evidence all points
   to Luke.
   As his journey to uncover the truth unfolds in the North Georgia
   Appalachians, a threat arises that will risk everything he holds close,
   including his ex-wife and their young daughter. Now Luke must chase his
   father’s darkness through a centuries-old secret and learn what
   monsters truly are. And decide if he’s one of them.
   [scarlett.jpg]
   The Scarlet Ball by Nghi Vo - Oct 6, 2026
   Official Blurb: Judith Ban – convent girl, courtesan, and failed thief
   – is looking for her next identity. She’s no stranger to wealth or
   danger, but the glitter of New York’s Gilded Age hides a darkness even
   she has never imagined. Here, the city’s elite maintain their grip
   through opulent balls, whispered rituals, and marriages with demons
   hungry for human devotion.
   When she crosses paths with the formidable matriarch of the Howard
   family, Judith is offered an irresistible bargain: to take the place of
   a missing debutante in the coming season. With Miss Iphigenia
   Marshall’s face stitched over her own, Judith becomes white, rich, and
   ready to risk it all. If she can hold onto her charm, her wits, and her
   life, her reward will be a husband with undreamt-of power.
   But in a world ruled by appetite and ambition, the most dangerous
   hunger of all might be her own.
   [splintered.jpg]
   The Splintered Sun by Tad Williams - Oct 6, 2026
   Unofficial Summary: From the much-loved, Sunday Times bestselling
   author comes a thrilling new tale set in the legendary world of Osten
   Ard. This fast-moving adventure follows bandit and chieftain Flann
   Alderwood - a mythic, swashbuckling figure whose name is whispered
   across the realm-and his band of misfit rebels as they navigate a
   kingdom menaced by dark sorcery and war.
   With the old King of Hernystir's health failing, warlords carve up the
   land and rival factions clash over the rightful heir. Into this chaos
   steps Flann, joined by allies both noble and common, to help the King's
   one legitimate heir claim his father's blessing and restore stability.
   But enemies, human and inhuman, stalk their every move, determined to
   end Flann's quest before it begins.
   Packed with action, unforgettable characters, and the sweeping
   imagination that has made Tad Williams one of fantasy's most beloved
   voices, this is Osten Ard as you've never seen it before.
   [thrice%20bound.jpg]
   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?
   [trust.jpg]
   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.
   [RedWinter_dust-jacket-1.jpg]
   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.
   [THE-MISHEARD-WORLD_.jpg]
   The Misheard World by Aliya Whiteley - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Before wars are won, they must be witnessed.
   Elize Janview is a soldier, one of the few survivors of an unimaginably
   terrible weapon, which ended the long détente between the North and the
   South and plunged them back into all-out war. She enlisted with a dream
   of finding those responsible, of somehow getting revenge for the deaths
   of everyone she knew, but was posted to guard the prison at Crag, the
   fortress of the South, which has never fallen to the enemy.
   Janview’s life is transformed when a rough wooden box is delivered to
   Crag, holding the performer and spy Marius Mondegreen, agent of the
   North: the Misheard Word, who can read minds, breathe fire, and make
   objects appear and disappear. Janview is to witness Mondegreen’s
   interrogation by his captor, the beautiful and cruel Allynx Syld, who
   promises the end of the war. As recorder – and by degrees participant –
   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew
   about the war, and the very world she lives in…
   [Screen-Shot-2025-10-11-at-10.58.02-AM.jpg]
   The Library of Amorlin by Kalyn J0sephson - Mar 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: Kasira used to be a masterful con artist: choosing her
   target, building trust, judging the precise moment to make her move.
   Now, she’s working off a lengthy prison sentence by hunting dangerous
   magical creatures on behalf of the fanatical kingdom of Kalthos.
   But Kasira’s past catches up to her when the ambassador from Kalthos
   arrives at her camp with a deal: her freedom in exchange for
   infiltrating and destabilizing the magical institution meant to protect
   all six kingdoms—the Library of Amorlin.
   When Kasira assumes the role of the new Assistant Librarian, she enters
   an enchanting world brimming with books and beasts, tempting her with a
   life she can never have. But Kasira’s real future depends on her long
   con to bring down the Librarian. Unfortunately, Allaster is as prickly
   as he is handsome, and his monstrous secrets are about to catch up with
   them both . . .
   [9781835411384.tiff]
   Entwined by H. M. Long - Mar 10, 2026
   Official Blurb: Ottilie Rushforth hides from the mighty Sorcerer’s
   Guild as secretary to a has-been detective. She is Entwined – threads
   of magic run beneath her skin, and the Guild would trap her in service.
   But Ottilie has a plan to escape the Guild forever with her estranged
   fiancé, the enigmatic poet, soldier and smuggler Lewis Illing. All she
   must do is track down a mysterious artefact, claim the bounty, and
   leave the city forever. But Ottilie's sisters – Pretoria, a
   quick-witted sorceress and thief recently emerged from exile, and
   Madge, a guild mage to the core, appear to make equally unwelcome
   offers. A new life at the cost of everything she has ever wanted, or
   prestige and safety in a gilded cage.
   With her life on the line, Ottilie must track down the artifact in a
   city torn apart by prejudice and violence, and choose between the two
   sides of herself – the fugitive and the Entwined.
   [aicha.jpg]
   Aicha by Soraya Bouazzoui - Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: The Portuguese empire has planted its flag across
   Morocco, ruling with an iron fist. But eventually, all empires must
   fall.
   Aicha, the daughter of a Moroccan freedom-fighter, was born for battle.
   She has witnessed the death of her people, their starvation and torture
   at the hands of the occupiers, and it has awakened an anger within her.
   An anger that burns hot and bright and that speaks to Aicha’s soul.
   Only Aicha’s secret lover, Rachid, a rebellion leader, knows how to
   soothe her. But as the fight for Morocco’s freedom reaches its violent
   climax, the creature that simmers beneath Aicha’s skin begs to be
   unleashed. It hungers for the screams of those who have caused her
   pain, and it will not be ignored.
   [daughter.jpg]
   Daughter Of Crows by Mark Lawrence -  Mar 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Set a thief to catch a thief. Set a monster to punish
   monsters.
   The Academy of Kindness exists to create agents of retribution, cast in
   the image of the Furies—known as the kindly ones—against whom even the
   gods hesitate to stand. Each year a hundred girls are sold to the
   Academy. Ten years later only three will emerge.
   The Academy’s halls run with blood. The few that survive its
   decade-long nightmare have been forged on the sands of the Wound
   Garden. They have learned ancient secrets amid the necrotic fumes of
   the Bone Garden. They leave its gates as avatars of vengeance, bound to
   uphold the oldest of laws.
   Only the most desperate would sell their child to the Kindnesses. But
   Rue … she sold herself. And now, a lifetime later, a long and bloody
   lifetime later, just as she has discovered peace, war has been brought
   to an old woman’s doorstep.
   That was a mistake.
   [Kingdom.jpg]
   This Kingdom Will Not Kill Me by Ilona Andrews - Mar 31, 2026
   Official Blurb: When Maggie wakes up cold, filthy, and naked in a
   gutter, it doesn't take her long to recognize Kair Toren, a city she
   knows intimately from the pages of the famously unfinished dark fantasy
   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,
   magic, and mayhem? Her encyclopedic knowledge of the plot, the setting,
   and the characters' ambitions and fates. But while she quickly
   discovers she cannot be killed (though many will try!), the same cannot
   be said for the living, breathing characters she's coming to love―a
   motley band that includes a former lady’s maid, a deadly assassin,
   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.
   Soon, instead of trying to get home, she finds herself enmeshed in the
   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all
   while trying to save them and the kingdom of Rellas from the way she
   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.
   [sttel%20gods.jpg]

   Looms. And the Empire of the Wolf teeters on the brink.

   The true horror of the Great Silence has been revealed. As nation after
   nation succumbs to the mind-plague and Sova scrambles to enlist help
   from across the globe, Ambassador Renata Rainer has been given a simple
   task: save the world. While she travels to the Principality of Casimir
   to enlist the help of the Empire’s oldest enemy, Lieutenant Peter
   Kleist returns to the haunted forests of the New East to search for
   ancient answers—and finally confront the terrible fate that awaits him.

   In their wake, a task force of engineers, soldiers, and arcane experts
   will try and unpick the final secrets of the Great Silence—on both
   sides of the mortal plane. But time is running out. Count Lamprecht von
   Oldenburg has returned to the capital, armed with a terrible vision and
   enough madness to see it through. Those who stand in his way face a
   simple choice: join the revolution, or die.

   As the world tips towards chaos, all paths converge on the Eye of the
   Sea, where the fabric of reality wears thin—and where the Empire of the
   Wolf must confront the most terrible enemy it has ever known.
   [detective.jpg]

   of the investigators who went in search of them have disappeared, too.
   Now Sam Speedman, a most unique private detective, is on the case.
   Brilliant, direct and disarming, Sam is ... not your average detective.
   But then again, this isn't your average case. For not even Sam is
   prepared for the long-buried secrets he will find.
   Set in the most isolated corners of the American South, tapping into
   the dark currents that simmer beneath the surface of the modern United

   [Sarafina_Cover.jpg]
   Sarafina by Philip Fracassi - Apr 7, 2026
   Official Blurb: Choosing to risk execution rather than be killed in a
   losing war, three brothers desert their posts and begin a long, arduous
   journey back home. After weeks of dealing with rough terrain while
   evading bandits and home guard soldiers—starving, injured, and
   exhausted—the brothers find a miracle deep in the dark woods. A home.
   Living in a remote cabin is a beautiful woman, Sarafina, and her young
   son, Titus. Sarafina takes the soldiers in, cares for them, feeds them,
   offers them a place to rest. But the youngest of the brothers is
   wary—something is not what it seems. After discovering a mysterious
   creek and a strange underground cavern, he gets a strong sense that the
   cabin, and the fertile land surrounding it, might be harboring
   something nefarious, terrifying, and dangerous.
   What ensues is a nightmare beyond imagination, an escalation of horrors
   that the brothers must somehow fight to survive. With tensions high,
   the country divided, and loyalties put to the test, Sarafina spotlights
   that Fracassi is a star of modern horror.
   [first%20mage.jpg]
   First Mage on the Moon by Cameron Johnston - Apr 14, 2026
   Official Blurb: Ella Pickering is drowning in debt. Once a Unity
   skymage trained to make aerial supply runs in the great war with the
   Ranneas Empire, following a crash she now uses a wheelchair and works
   gruelling shifts making magical weapons in the Unity workshops,

   One night Ella witnesses an experiment by engineer Jackan Grissom go
   awry. His device morphs into a crude rocket blasting skywards before
   falling into the war’s spell-ravaged No Man’s Land. But this inspires a
   dangerous dream: could such a device reach the moon – the forbidden
   home of the gods? Could they go and beg them to stop the war?
   They will need help, but as more folk get involved in their blasphemous
   plot, can they keep it under wraps? Can magic get them to the moon? Or
   will their heresy lead them to the gallows?
   [9781335001559.jpg]
   Japanese Gothic by Kylie Lee Baker - Apr 21, 2026
   Official Blurb: October, 2026: Lee Turner doesn’t remember how or why
   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.
   October, 1877: Sen is a young samurai in exile, hiding from the
   imperial soldiers in a house behind the sword ferns. A monster came
   home from war wearing her father’s face, but Sen would do anything to
   please him, even turn her sword on her own mother. She knows the
   soldiers will soon slaughter her whole family when she sees a terrible
   omen: a young foreign man who appears outside her window.
   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.
   [Ode.jpg]
   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.
   [a-river-red-with-blood-9781668083970_xlg.jpg]
   A River Red With Blood by John Connolly - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: The players call it the Game, and its aim is simple: to
   abduct and kill a stranger without getting caught. They're very good at
   it. They've been playing it for a long time. And they can keep playing
   so long as everyone stick to the rules: No Killing Close to Home and No
   Killing Outside the Game.
   But those rules have been broken.
   When the drowned body of a troubled teenager is recovered from a river
   in Maine's Kennebec Valley, and a young woman disappears from a small
   rural town, they draw the attention of the private investigator named
   Charlie Parker.
   Now Parker will be forced to confront a band of men without morality
   and without loyalty, not even to one another, in a place where the very
   darkness is alive.
   Because something has emerged from the shadows, something very bad. And
   it wants revenge.

   The Girl with a Thousand Faces by Sunyi Dean - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: When Mercy Chan washed up on the shores of Hong Kong
   with no family, no money, and no memories, the only place she could
   find refuge was in the infamous, ghost-infested slum of Kowloon Walled
   City. Since then, she has rebuilt her life working for the local triad
   as a ghost-talker and dealing with the angry and bitter spirits who
   haunt the district. The filthy gutters and cramped alleyways of Kowloon
   now feel like home.
   But the past Mercy can’t remember won’t let her go. An unusually
   powerful ghost has infested Kowloon’s waterways, drowning innocents and
   threatening the district. It claims to know Mercy—and secrets from her
   past that are best left forgotten.
   As Mercy is drawn into a deadly cat-and-mouse game with this malignant
   spirit, she begins to realize that the monster she fights within these
   walls may well be one of her own making.

   The Last Contract of Isako by Fonda Lee - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: LIVE BY THE CODE. DIE BY THE KNIFE.
   Isako is a legendary swordswoman, but every legend must come to an end.
   When her long-time client unexpectedly retires, she plans to follow—to
   walk out into the frozen wasteland of their planet with her head held
   high and her family enriched by her death. But when she's offered a
   final mission, she can't refuse, especially when she realizes who lies
   at the center of it all: Martim, her last—and worst—apprentice, who's
   somehow made his way to the top. As she's thrust into a world of
   corporate espionage and shadowy secrets, what she uncovers could
   forever change humanity's existence among the stars.
   The Last Contract of Isako is epic science fiction like only Fonda Lee
   can write it—set in a world where money trumps loyalty, the elite have
   the power to extend life or end it, and one woman in the twilight of
   her calling must decide what's ultimately worth living—or dying—for.

   Sisters of the Lizard by Jackson Ford - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: All Sayana wanted was to enjoy her life in the rolling
   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   Cold Wind by Andrew Givler – May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: Lost and forgotten, Castor is a prisoner of the very
   Iron Empire he once served.
   Thought of as a common criminal, Castor guards his dangerous
   secret—that he has bound a second Symbol—with his life. If the Censors
   knew, they’d execute him on the spot.
   There is only one path to freedom and avenging his family. He must earn
   it no longer as a member of the Iron Legions, but by spilling blood for
   one of the great Houses.
   The dead gods stir in their rotting slumber. Dangerous enemies stalk
   his new master. Surrounded on all sides, Castor must learn the secrets
   of his Cor Heart and reach new heights of power before it is too late.
   And in the wake of his Ascent comes the first sign of change – A COLD
   WIND.

   [outlaw.jpg]
   Outlaw by Jim Butcher - May 12, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a city that’s just beginning to recover from the
   devastation caused by the Battle of Chicago, Harry Dresden is finally
   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .
   [Mortedant.jpg]
   Mortedant's Peril by RJ Barker - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Irody can speak to the dead. But the living want him
   silenced.
   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the
   city’s guilds, nobles and villains all fixed on him.
   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a
   hulking, inhuman mercenary from the sea people’s city of Oknosuka. With
   danger and death lurking round every corner, and trust a luxury, Irody
   is running out of time. He must save himself and his friends as well as
   Elbay – the magnificent, terrifying, complicated city that he loves. Or
   darkness will fall on them all.
   [tapestry.jpg]
   The Tapestry of Fate by Shannon Chakraborty - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Amina al-Sirafi thinks she’s struck gold. Tasked with
   hunting down magical artifacts for the council of immortal peris, she
   can savour the occasional adventure on the high seas with her cherished
   criminal companions while still returning home to raise her beloved
   daughter.
   But when Raksh, the spirit of discord with whom she is reluctantly wed,
   provokes the council’s wrath, Amina is charged with a seemingly
   impossible quest: steal a spindle capable of rewriting fate from a
   mysterious sorceress on an island no one can escape.
   Forced to leave her daughter, Amina finds her mission almost
   immediately thrown into peril. But deadly storms, an erratic poison
   mistress, and old enemies are the least of her worries. For the peris’
   story is unravelling, hinting at a far deadlier game whose rules Amina
   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   Sister Svangerd and the Devil You Know by KJ Parker - May 26, 2026
   BLURB TO BE REVEALED LATER
   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.
   [rjb.jpg]
   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.
   [inkpot.jpg]
   Inkpot Gods by Seanan McGuire - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: The gods live and die at our whim.
   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?
   [tinder.jpg]
   The Tinder Box by M R Carey - Jun 23, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a kingdom forgotten by history, a legend unfolds . .
   .
   Wounded in his county's endless wars, former soldier Mag Tresti finds
   work in the home of a reclusive widow, Jannae Mirchella. But Jannae is
   more than she seems. A witch of great skill and might, she hides her
   powers and her deep-laid plans behind a mask of harmless
   respectability.
   When a dead demon falls out of the sky, the fates of the soldier and
   the witch are irrevocably intertwined. On the demon's body Mag finds a
   tinderbox - an artefact of terrifying magical power that can not only
   grant his every wish, but also change the fate of nations.
   This is a tale of spellcraft and devilry, of witchcraft and trickery -
   of the wickedness that resides within a few, the goodness that lies
   deep within us all, and the choices on which our lives turn.
   [harpy.jpg]
   The Harpy Knight by Sara Omer - Jul 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: With Bataar's campaign to conquer Dumakra victorious,
   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are
   increasingly powerful, and his hold on Dumakra more secure by the day.
   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.
   The war, and the world, hang in the balance. Just one wrong move could
   tip everything into chaos.

   The Infinite State by Richard Swan - Aug 4, 2026
   Official Blurb: THE INFINITE STATE begins at a flashpoint in the lives
   of a widowed party member, a disgraced investigator, and a hypersled
   pilot—entangled in a plot to escape the suffocating authority of a
   fascist state.
   WHO GIVES YOU LIFE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Katherine Fuller’s husband is dead. As an esteemed member of Pater
   Aeternus—governing party of the fascist, galaxy-spanning Decurion
   Empire—he has left behind an estate of immeasurable wealth. And
   Katherine is going to inherit it.
   WHO GIVES YOU PURPOSE?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   Life under the Eternal Father is rigidly stratified, surveilled, and
   controlled—each new day to be endured, not lived. But with Katherine’s
   newfound fortune, she is presented with a rare and dangerous
   opportunity: purchase a virgin world, and create a better, fairer
   society.
   WHO GIVES YOU JOY?
   PATER AETERNUS.
   But the Empire cannot allow its wayward daughter to succeed. And as
   Katherine works in secret, recruiting allies she's not even sure she
   can trust, she will discover exactly how far Pater Aeternus is willing
   to go to stop her. Because Katherine is going to create something
   nobody has seen for many years.
   A democracy.

   The Dungeon Book by Gareth Hanrahan - Aug 11, 2026
   Official Blurb: Enter a world of dungeons and dragons, magic and
   manticores, and goblins and gargoyles . . .
   Bait doesn't remember a time before the dungeon. Before the dragon
   stole her from her cot. She doesn't know what her name was before she
   was handed over to the monstrous denizens of the dungeon beneath the
   sorcerer's tower. Luckily for Bait, they decided not to eat her. And so
   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful
   minotaur her protector, a sentient skull her tutor, and a blob of
   corridor slime her main source of nutrition.
   But the labyrinthine dungeon, with its haunted halls, buried temples
   and forgotten magics, draws treasure hunters like moths to flame. And
   as the outside world starts to intrude, Bait will learn what it means
   to be monstrous and she will have to decide where she truly belongs.
   [knave.jpg]
   The Knave and the Moon by Rachel Gillig - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: Aisling Cathedral is in ruins. Rodrick Myndacious,
   Bartholomew, and Maude Bauer are rumored to be dead—and the king has
   taken Sybil Delling as his bride. To show off their union and solidify
   his power over Traum, Benji proposes a series of tournaments throughout
   the hamlets. Captive and drugged, Sybil remains determined to vanquish
   him as she once did the Omens, even if she destroys the kingdom’s
   faith—and herself—in the process.
   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.
   [coming-soon.jpg]
   Blacktail by Scott Hawkins - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: The wolf Blacktail is faithful to his Forest God, but
   in these times, faith is not enough. His world is besieged by men. Soon
   his territory will be overrun, and then there will be nowhere left to
   go. When his mate, a house dog, is killed, Blacktail rebels. He invades
   the house of her owners, seeking vengeance.
   Blacktail’s fury catches the notice of an ancient and terrible feline
   witch, who makes an offer. What if Blacktail could end the human race
   responsible for the death of his family and for the destruction of the
   natural world, altogether? To do so, Blacktail must find and wake the
   Forest God. Only He might stand against the plague of men. Blacktail
   knows that his north woods are dwindling to nothing. He sees no other
   choice.
   As Blacktail journeys farther from his wild home and deeper into the
   world of man, he encounters strangers—animal, mortal, and
   otherworldly—who, for their own reasons, want to help Blacktail rid the
   world of humans. Along the way, it becomes clear that he is more than
   just a wolf. The Forest God is sleeping, yes. But what will be the
   price of waking him?
   [EXIT.jpg]
   Exit Party by Emily St. John Mendel - Sep 15, 2026
   Official Blurb: Los Angeles, 2031: The first spring after the collapse
   of the United States, peacekeeping troops withdraw from the city, the
   Jacaranda trees blossom, and the curfew is finally lifted. Ari Waker
   and her roommate pass the gauntlet of bomb-sniffing dogs, the shanty
   towns, and the Red Cross tents as they walk across Silverlake to a
   party. The mood is ecstatic inside the apartment, people drink and
   dance, a woman wears a silver dress, pleated like tinfoil. And then: A
   shift. A bewildered twin, an uncanny doppelganger stumbles through the
   crowd and out into the night, and Kareem, the party’s host, vanishes
   into thin air.
   As Ari Waker unravels the mystery of this inexplicable night, Emily St.
   John Mandel unfurls a story that takes us from a future America
   splintered by civil war to the seaside cliffs of Greece where weapons
   dealers hide in an elegant resort, and from the domed city of Paris to
   a colony on the moon. An unforgettable literary feat, Exit Party is a
   novel about the price of safety, the perils of the surveillance state,
   a requiem for a world not unlike our own, and a breathtaking story of
   resilience in the face of cataclysmic change.

   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her

   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.

Fantasy Book Critic's Most Anticipated SFF Books of 2026


   [twelve%20months.jpg]

   Twelve Months by Jim Butcher - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: One year. 365 days. Twelve months.
   Harry Dresden has been through a lot, and so has his city. After Harry
   and his allies narrowly managed to save Chicago from being razed to the
   ground, everything is different—and it’s not just the current lack of
   electricity.
   In the battle, Harry lost people he cared about. And that's the kind of
   loss that takes a toll. Harry being Harry, he’s doing his level best to
   help the city and his friends recover and rebuild. But it’s a heavy
   load, and he needs time.
   But time is one thing Harry doesn’t have. Ghouls are prowling Chicago
   and taking out innocent civilians. Harry’s brother is dying, and Harry
   doesn’t know how to help him. And last but certainly not least, the
   Winter Queen of the Fae has allied with the White Court of vampires—and
   Harry’s been betrothed to the seductive, deadly vampire Lara Raith to
   seal the deal.
   It's been a tough year. More than ever, the city needs Harry Dresden
   the wizard—but after loss and grief, is there enough left of Harry
   Dresden the man to rise to the challenge?
   [poet.jpg]
   The Poet Empress by Shen Tao - Jan 20, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the waning years of the Azalea Dynasty, the emperor
   is dying, the land consumed by famine, and poetry magic lost to all
   except the powerful.
   Wei Yin is desperate. After the fifth death of a sibling, with her
   family and village on the brink of starvation, she will do anything to
   save those she loves.
   Even offer herself as concubine to the cruel heir of the beautiful and
   brutal Azalea House. But in a twist of fate, the palace stands on the
   knife-edge of civil war with Wei trapped in its center…at the side of a
   violent prince.
   To survive, Wei must harden her heart, rely on her wit, and become
   dangerous herself. Even if it means becoming a poet in a world where
   women are forbidden to read—and composing the most powerful spell of
   all. A ballad of death...and love.
   [Sister%20Svangerd%20and%20the%20Not%20Quite%20Dead.jpg]
   Sister Svangerd and the Not Quite Dead by KJ Parker - Jan 27, 2026
   Official Blurb: ​Not even the Church of the Invincible Sun is
   invincible – and somebody has to do its dirty work. Enter Sister
   Svangerd and her accompanying priest, both first-rate practitioners.
   Their mission is simple: to make a meddlesome princess disappear
   (permanently).

   To get to her, they must attend the legendary Ecumenical Council, the
   once-in-a-century convening of the greatest spiritual minds the world
   has to offer. But when they arrive, they find instead a den of villainy
   that would make the most hardened criminal blush.
   To complicate matters further, it appears that some people who were
   definitely grim reapered might be not quite dead after all. What began
   as a little assassination is about to escalate into a theological
   debate with terrifying consequences for everyone.
   [Pendergast.jpg]
   Pendergast: The Beginning by Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child - Jan 27,
   2026
   Official Blurb:  It only took six months for the life of Special Agent
   Dwight Chambers to crumble around him. First, he lost his partner, and
   then, tragically, his wife. Returning to work at the New Orleans Field
   Office, Chambers is dismayed to find himself saddled with mentoring a
   brand new FBI agent—a certain A. X. L. Pendergast. As Chambers tries to
   pull himself together, his enigmatic and exasperating junior partner
   pulls an outrageous stunt that gets both of them suspended.
   Pendergast welcomes the banishment, because it gives him the
   opportunity to investigate a peculiar murder in Mississippi that has
   captured his fancy. Chambers grudgingly goes along. What starts off as
   a whimsical quest swiftly turns into a terrifying pursuit, as Chambers
   and Pendergast uncover a string of grisly, ritualistic killings that
   defy any known serial killer profile.

   Thanks in large part to Pendergast’s brilliance and unorthodox methods,
   they solve the case and find the killer… and that is when the true
   horror begins.
   [Vivian-Dies-Again-HB-scaled.jpg]
   Vivian Dies Again by Caroline Hulse - Jan 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: Time heals all wounds. Except blunt force trauma.
   Vivian Slade is a cautionary tale. The wrong side of thirty, she's no
   longer the life and soul of the party - she's a party of one. But she's
   determined to turn over a new leaf, even if that means going to a
   family gathering where everyone hates her.
   Turns out, someone really hates her - enough to push her off a balcony
   to a very messy end. But then Vivian wakes up! Only to be murdered
   again. And again. Stuck in a baffling time loop, Vivian's only ally is
   a sleep-deprived waiter who just wants to finish his shift. Will Vivian
   be able to solve her own murder? Only time will tell...
   [hammerfall.jpg]
   Hammerfall by Rob J Hayes - Feb 3, 2026
   Official Blurb: How long can a cause remain just, when painted in the
   blood of innocence?
   They named her the Starhammer once. Hero to some, monster to many more.
   First into the breach at the Shattering, anointed in the blood of a
   thousand demons. The last of the legendary Valkyr.
   But the Starhammer is dead. Or so all the stories tell.
   Amidst the soaring trees and haunted slopes of the Primals, Selitha
   relies on the forest to provide, and cares for her family. Nothing is
   more precious to her than her daughter.
   It is a simple life. It is a peaceful life. It is a lie.
   When bandits raid the Primals, burning towns and stealing children from
   their beds, Selitha has no choice but to lend her axe to the rescue.
   Volcanic giants spew ash into the sky, demonic bears claw the forest to
   splinters, and there are even rumours the kin, half-men half-beasts,
   serve the raiders. All the Terrors of the old world stand against her.
   With a severed head as guide, to rescue the children, Selitha may need
   to bring the Starhammer back from the dead.
   But will it be the hero who rises from the grave, or the monster?
   [trust.jpg]
   Trust No One by James Rollins - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Knowledge can be magic—until it falls into the wrong
   hands.
   The ritualistic murder of a British professor at the University of
   Exeter points to a startling cast of suspects: his own students. All
   are enrolled in a postgraduate program covering the history of
   witchcraft, folklore, and spiritualism.

   All evidence points to Sharyn Karr—an American student. Prior to the
   professor’s death, he had thrust a centuries-old book upon her. It
   appears to be the handwritten and encrypted diary of an
   eighteenth-century mystic and occultist, the Comte de Saint-Germain.
   The professor begged her to keep the text safe, ending with a warning.

   Trust no one.

   Such a responsibility forces her into cooperation with Duncan Maxwell,
   a fellow postgrad and the sixteenth in line to the British Crown.
   Already, Duncan has proven himself a savant with encryptions.
   Unfortunately, the pair clash at every level, but they both need one
   another. Especially when they discover the book’s opening words:
   Herein lies the secret to my immortality. Come find me, if you dare.

   As dark forces close upon the pair, Sharyn and her friends are forced
   to flee, pursued by law enforcement and hunted by a powerful cabal. In
   an explosive chase across Europe—from the Tower of London to Parisian
   chateaus to a fortress in the Italian Alps—Sharyn must learn the true
   secret hidden in Saint-Germain’s text. It will send her and the others
   across history and deep into the heart of one of the world’s greatest
   mysteries, a secret buried at the roots of Western Civilization, a
   discovery that could topple empires and change humanity forever.

   For what lies at the end of Saint-Germain’s diary is as shocking as its
   opening words.
   [RedWinter_dust-jacket-1.jpg]
   The Red Winter by Cameron Sullivan - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: In 1785, Professor Sebastian Grave receives the news he
   fears most: the terrible Beast of Gévaudan has returned, and the French
   countryside runs red in its wake.
   Sebastian knows the Beast. A monster-slayer with centuries of
   experience, he joined the hunt for the creature twenty years ago and
   watched it slaughter its way through a long and bloody winter. Even
   with the help of his indwelling demon, Sarmodel – who takes payment in
   living hearts – it nearly cost him his life to bring the monster down.
   Now, two decades later, Sebastian has been recalled to the hunt by
   Antoine Avenel d’Ocerne, an estranged lover who shares a dark history
   with the Beast and a terrible secret with Sebastian. Drawn by both the
   chance to finish the Beast for good and the promise of a reconciliation
   with Antoine, Sebastian cannot refuse.
   But Gévaudan is not as he remembers it, and Sebastian’s unfinished
   business is everywhere he looks. Years of misery have driven the people
   to desperation, and France teeters on the edge of revolution.
   Sebastian’s arcane activities – not to mention his demonic counterpart
   – have also attracted the inquisitorial eye of the French clergy. And
   the Beast is poised to close his jaws around them all and plunge the
   continent into war.
   [THE-MISHEARD-WORLD_.jpg]
   The Misheard World by Aliya Whiteley - Feb 24, 2026
   Official Blurb: Before wars are won, they must be witnessed.
   Elize Janview is a soldier, one of the few survivors of an unimaginably
   terrible weapon, which ended the long détente between the North and the
   South and plunged them back into all-out war. She enlisted with a dream
   of finding those responsible, of somehow getting revenge for the deaths
   of everyone she knew, but was posted to guard the prison at Crag, the
   fortress of the South, which has never fallen to the enemy.

   in the interrogation, Janview comes to question everything she knew

   quick-witted sorceress and thief recently emerged from exile, and
   Madge, a guild mage to the core, appear to make equally unwelcome

   series she's been obsessively reading and re-reading while waiting
   years for the final novel.
   Her only tools for navigating this gritty world of rival warlords,

   and the characters' ambitions and fates. But while she quickly
   discovers she cannot be killed (though many will try!), the same cannot

   various outrageous magical creatures, and a dangerously appealing
   soldier.
   Soon, instead of trying to get home, she finds herself enmeshed in the
   schemes―and attentions―of dueling princes, dukes, and villains, all

   knows their stories will end: in a cataclysmic war.

   Official Blurb: October, 2026: Lee Turner doesn’t remember how or why
   he killed his college roommate. The details are blurred and bloody. All
   he knows is he has to flee New York and go to the one place that might
   offer refuge—his father’s new home in Japan, a house hidden by sword
   ferns and wild ginger. But something is terribly wrong with the house:
   no animals will come near it, the bedroom window isn't always a window,
   and a woman with a sword appears in the yard when night falls.

   One of these people is a ghost, and one of these stories is a lie.
   Something is hiding beneath the house of sword ferns, and Lee and Sen
   will soon wish they never unburied it.

   Ode to the Half-Broken by Suzanne Palmer - Apr 28, 2026
   Official Blurb: Forty years ago, the world nearly ended.
   Be is an old robot who was there, and doesn't want to think about what
   happened, or what role they played in that conflict. They have settled
   into a life of isolation in the abandoned ruins of an old mill in the
   former New York Botanical Gardens, disinterested in what has happened
   in the outside world since they stepped away from the war. Someone out
   there, though, has not forgotten about them, and when they are
   attacked, their person vandalized, and one of their legs stolen, they
   set out to find the thief accompanied by a cyborg dog and a human
   mechanic.
   The world has changed, but the recovery from the war is uneven and
   faltering, and Be begins to suspect a malicious hand trying to rekindle
   the old conflict and finish what was started. In order to stop them, Be
   needs to come to terms with both their own past and who they have
   become, and how everything and everyone else they knew has changed in
   their absence. Being left alone is no longer an option, and peace may
   be impossible.
   This is a story about coming to terms with your past, with who you’ve
   become and who you still want to be: a tale of resilience and hope, an
   ode to those struggling to become whole in a world half-broken.

   Official Blurb: The players call it the Game, and its aim is simple: to

   Killing Outside the Game.
   But those rules have been broken.
   When the drowned body of a troubled teenager is recovered from a river
   in Maine's Kennebec Valley, and a young woman disappears from a small

   Sisters of the Lizard by Jackson Ford - May 5, 2026
   Official Blurb: All Sayana wanted was to enjoy her life in the rolling
   grasslands of the Tapestry. After she and her fellow Rakada managed to
   ride humongous, fire-breathing lizards to face down the Great Khan’s
   army, they should have been able to kick back a little for once. Not
   too much to ask, right?
   Instead, the Tapestry is in turmoil – invading armies threaten, the
   other raider clans are at war, and inside his fortress city of
   Karkorum, the Khan broods and plots. What’s more, the Rakada’s giant
   lizards are getting sick, and they have no idea how to cure them. If
   they die, there's no telling what might happen to the Tapestry.
   But then the Rakada receive a vision – apparently from the gods. A deep
   emerald pool surrounded by bone-white sands – one that may be able to
   heal their lizards. With no other option, the raiders set out on an
   epic quest across the mountains and into the desert.
   But the danger that awaits them will be one greater than they’ve ever
   faced before. These guys really can’t catch a break.

   Outlaw by Jim Butcher - May 12, 2026
   Official Blurb: In a city that’s just beginning to recover from the
   devastation caused by the Battle of Chicago, Harry Dresden is finally
   pulling himself together as well. He''s ensconced in his own personal
   castle, healing his various wounds and training an eager new
   apprentice. The last thing he wants is any trouble. But, as history has
   consistently—and quite annoyingly—shown, what Harry wants is rarely
   what Harry gets.
   It starts with a visit from Harry’s most powerful frenemy, Gentleman
   John Marcone, Baron of Chicago. He needs Harry to assist in the
   redemption of an underling who’s looking to go straight. And since
   Harry does kinda sorta owe Marcone for saving his life once (stupid
   honorable debt!), it’s not a request he can refuse. He’ll just wish he
   had.
   Because this little favor is going to drag Harry into a fight he
   doesn’t want on behalf of a lowlife he doesn’t trust against an enemy
   more powerful and pestilent than he ever could’ve expected: an
   insatiable, demonic foe whom Harry himself may have created when he
   wiped out the vampires of the Red Court so long ago.
   Before, all it wanted was blood. Now it wants the entire world . . .

   Mortedant's Peril by RJ Barker - May 19, 2026
   Official Blurb: Irody can speak to the dead. But the living want him
   silenced.
   Mortedants can speak to the dead – and Irody Hasp is the greatest of
   them. Not that they’ll admit it. And not that anyone actually likes the
   Mortedants, or Irody in particular.
   Nonetheless, Elbay is a city of tradition, and tradition calls for
   Mortedants to attend a death. But when Irody reads the corpse of a
   low-level worker, he’s dragged into a conspiracy that will see those
   closest to him murdered and Irody framed for the crime, the eyes of the
   city’s guilds, nobles and villains all fixed on him.
   With only days to prove his innocence before his execution, Irody is
   forced to work with unlikely and unwanted allies: a street urchin and a
   hulking, inhuman mercenary from the sea people’s city of Oknosuka. With
   danger and death lurking round every corner, and trust a luxury, Irody
   is running out of time. He must save himself and his friends as well as
   Elbay – the magnificent, terrifying, complicated city that he loves. Or

   mysterious sorceress on an island no one can escape.
   Forced to leave her daughter, Amina finds her mission almost
   immediately thrown into peril. But deadly storms, an erratic poison
   mistress, and old enemies are the least of her worries. For the peris’
   story is unravelling, hinting at a far deadlier game whose rules Amina
   must swiftly puzzle out. A game that sets her against an adversary more
   cunning and powerful than she has ever faced.
   A game that not everyone on her crew wants her to win.

   [unicorn.jpg]
   The Unicorn Hunters by Katherine Arden - Jun 2, 2026
   Official Blurb: Anne of Brittany was a child when her land was invaded,
   her castle besieged, and her royal father driven to his death.
   Now Brittany is occupied by her enemies, her treasury empty, and only
   one thing is lacking to complete her realm’s subjugation: she is
   required, on pain of the sword, to marry the King of France.
   But Anne cannot. She has promised her dead father that Brittany would
   never be conquered. Defiantly, she betroths herself in secret to
   France’s greatest enemy. But in a world where courts may spy on each
   other by magic, there is only one way to solemnize this illicit union.
   Under the guise of a hunting party, Anne takes her court deep into a
   deep forest, a strange place dogged with rumours of ancient
   enchantments; a place where diviners cannot see. She tells the French
   that she had gone there to hunt unicorns.
   It’s a ruse, a lie, a feint.
   But when, against all expectations, a unicorn does appear and a wounded
   stranger stumbles from the trees and falls at her feet, Anne is plunged
   into a world of enchantment where a doomed sovereign might find the
   power to change the destiny of her nation - or be lost in the mist for
   ever.

   A Trade of Blood by Robert Jackson Bennett - Jun 9, 2026
   Official Blurb: In the canton of Sapirdad, two of the Empire’s most
   powerful families are moments away from going to war with each other,
   their hundreds of retainers gathered with swords drawn. If blood is
   spilled, the whole of the empire may be plunged into starvation and
   chaos.
   To deescalate matters, someone must do the impossible: prove that one
   family’s eldest son is innocent of a gruesome and unforgivable murder,
   despite the incontrovertible evidence against him.
   It is with this undertaking that the great detective Ana Dolabra is
   tasked, her assistant Din at her side—and the two find themselves
   racing with great speed and little dignity to the scene.
   As ever, the impossible proves little obstacle for the deadly
   combination of Ana’s intellect and Din’s keen eye, and mere hours after
   riding into the dusty town, Ana glimpses the greater pattern behind the
   crime. A deeper, subtler web of death is being woven in plain sight, by
   a mastermind with an ancient magical technology at his disposal.
   But even Ana's uncanny insight is of little use when each new suspect
   she uncovers ends up dead--with each new killing calculated to bring
   tensions between the two rival clans past the boiling point. And as Din
   pursues their adversary through the canton's wild ranges, sprawling
   ranches, and reeking slaughterhouses, he finds his loyalties divided in
   unexpected ways.

   More than a century has passed since Asphodel Baker refined the process
   allowing her to imbue alchemically created life with power in a way no
   one else had ever been able to achieve. More than a century since she
   built the Impossible City on the ruins of Olympus, forging it from
   nothing more than imagination and spite, and penned it in plain view,
   enabling it to be read and cherished and believed by children the world
   over.
   And now, so long after her exit from the world, the descendants of her
   dark alchemy—who exist in a reality that inches ever closer to the
   hellscape of her imagination—step into a place of birth, of discovery,
   of horror, to make amends for the sins of the past.
   Can the gods of today defeat the evils of their maker, or will the
   legacy of the most powerful alchemist the world has ever known prove to
   be their undoing?

   he turns his eyes to Aglea in the north, where pagan berserkers rule
   over inhospitable marshes and ritualistically butcher unicorns. Prince
   Nassar and his entourage have also fled to Aglea to rally his
   supporters—taking the ghoulish variant of vermilrot they unearthed from
   the abandoned depths of Anhabar with them.
   Nohra and Bataar are soon to be married. Nohra has not forgiven the
   rhah's sins against Kalafar or her family, but her thirst for vengeance
   wars with her feelings for Qaira. Bataar's supernatural gifts are

   Serving him is now the only path Nohra can see that ends with her
   younger brother one day restored to Kalafar's throne.
   The power struggle between Bataar and Nassar fast becomes a swirling
   conflict of religions and gods: the Agleans revere Darya for her
   demonic powers; Nohra and Qaira are heralded as the two manifestations
   of Dumakra's Goddess; and Bataar is the walking embodiment of his
   people's Preeminent spirit. In this febrile atmosphere, the ghoul
   sickness is spreading rapidly, and monsters continue to encroach on
   human towns, causing violence and dismay.

   The Dungeon Book by Gareth Hanrahan - Aug 11, 2026
   Official Blurb: Enter a world of dungeons and dragons, magic and
   manticores, and goblins and gargoyles . . .
   Bait doesn't remember a time before the dungeon. Before the dragon
   stole her from her cot. She doesn't know what her name was before she
   was handed over to the monstrous denizens of the dungeon beneath the
   sorcerer's tower. Luckily for Bait, they decided not to eat her. And so
   she grew up in the dark – the goblins her adopted family, a vengeful
   minotaur her protector, a sentient skull her tutor, and a blob of
   corridor slime her main source of nutrition.
   But the labyrinthine dungeon, with its haunted halls, buried temples
   and forgotten magics, draws treasure hunters like moths to flame. And
   as the outside world starts to intrude, Bait will learn what it means
   to be monstrous and she will have to decide where she truly belongs.

   The Knave and the Moon by Rachel Gillig - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: Aisling Cathedral is in ruins. Rodrick Myndacious,
   Bartholomew, and Maude Bauer are rumored to be dead—and the king has
   taken Sybil Delling as his bride. To show off their union and solidify
   his power over Traum, Benji proposes a series of tournaments throughout
   the hamlets. Captive and drugged, Sybil remains determined to vanquish
   him as she once did the Omens, even if she destroys the kingdom’s
   faith—and herself—in the process.
   But then a mysterious knave rises to the top of the tournament lists, a
   man with no name and no memory who may just be Sybil'''s ticket to
   undoing Benji’s power. For in a land where stories repeat themselves,
   where a king can prove as cruel as a god, the only way to truly destroy
   the Stonewater Kingdom’s faith is to save it.

   Blacktail by Scott Hawkins - Sep 1, 2026
   Official Blurb: The wolf Blacktail is faithful to his Forest God, but
   in these times, faith is not enough. His world is besieged by men. Soon
   his territory will be overrun, and then there will be nowhere left to
   go. When his mate, a house dog, is killed, Blacktail rebels. He invades
   the house of her owners, seeking vengeance.
   Blacktail’s fury catches the notice of an ancient and terrible feline
   witch, who makes an offer. What if Blacktail could end the human race
   responsible for the death of his family and for the destruction of the
   natural world, altogether? To do so, Blacktail must find and wake the
   Forest God. Only He might stand against the plague of men. Blacktail
   knows that his north woods are dwindling to nothing. He sees no other
   choice.
   As Blacktail journeys farther from his wild home and deeper into the
   world of man, he encounters strangers—animal, mortal, and
   otherworldly—who, for their own reasons, want to help Blacktail rid the
   world of humans. Along the way, it becomes clear that he is more than
   just a wolf. The Forest God is sleeping, yes. But what will be the
   price of waking him?

   Exit Party by Emily St. John Mendel - Sep 15, 2026
   Official Blurb: Los Angeles, 2031: The first spring after the collapse
   of the United States, peacekeeping troops withdraw from the city, the
   Jacaranda trees blossom, and the curfew is finally lifted. Ari Waker
   and her roommate pass the gauntlet of bomb-sniffing dogs, the shanty
   towns, and the Red Cross tents as they walk across Silverlake to a
   party. The mood is ecstatic inside the apartment, people drink and
   dance, a woman wears a silver dress, pleated like tinfoil. And then: A
   shift. A bewildered twin, an uncanny doppelganger stumbles through the
   crowd and out into the night, and Kareem, the party’s host, vanishes
   into thin air.
   As Ari Waker unravels the mystery of this inexplicable night, Emily St.
   John Mandel unfurls a story that takes us from a future America
   splintered by civil war to the seaside cliffs of Greece where weapons
   dealers hide in an elegant resort, and from the domed city of Paris to
   a colony on the moon. An unforgettable literary feat, Exit Party is a
   novel about the price of safety, the perils of the surveillance state,
   a requiem for a world not unlike our own, and a breathtaking story of
   resilience in the face of cataclysmic change.

   Incarnate by Alma Katsu - Sep 22, 2026
   Official Blurb: Beauty doesn’t fade. It feeds.
   Marion Wagner has spent her whole life wanting nothing more than to be
   seen. But after failing to make her mark (any mark, really) as an
   influencer, she takes a job at a company focused on cutting-edge
   deepfake technology. And there, in secret, is where creates her
   salvation.
   Isabella. An impossibly gorgeous girl who takes social media by storm.
   Marion’s code is brilliant, and Isabella seems real. So real that she
   garners millions of followers. Brands beg to partner with her. Everyone
   wants to meet her IRL. The adoration—and the cash—flows in. Marion is
   finally happy. She's getting all the attention she ever wanted—isn't
   she?
   Then the cracks begin to show. Marion can barely stay ahead of the
   partnership requests, and love letters and the rabid fans filling her
   DMs trying to track Isabella down. All this time working in secret with
   all this pressure is getting to Marion—she can’t tell where she ends,
   and her creation begins. And when someone gets a little too close to
   her secret, a violent confrontation sends Marion on the run, forcing
   her to confront what she’s willing to sacrifice to keep her secrets.

   Nightjars by Michael Wehunt - Sep 29, 2026
   Official Blurb: One rainy night on a first date, Luke Oshel’s new crush
   never comes back from the restroom. But she leaves an old photograph
   under her napkin―Luke as a child, a dead body in the shadows of his
   bedroom, and a terrifying masked man. He has no recollection of this
   event.
   Then more photos disrupt his life���Luke posing with murder victims,
   covered in blood―and he falls back into the deep paranoia and repressed
   memories he’s tried to leave behind. All the drugs and alcohol,
   therapy, and hypnosis sessions have never conquered his deepest
   fear��that he hasn'''t escaped the hidden legacy of his father, who
   killed his victims by exsanguination before his own death. But now
   there is a new string of serial killings, and the evidence all points
   to Luke.
   As his journey to uncover the truth unfolds in the North Georgia
   Appalachians, a threat arises that will risk everything he holds close,
   including his ex-wife and their young daughter. Now Luke must chase his
   father’s darkness through a centuries-old secret and learn what
   monsters truly are. And decide if he’s one of them.

   The Scarlet Ball by Nghi Vo - Oct 6, 2026
   Official Blurb: Judith Ban – convent girl, courtesan, and failed thief
   – is looking for her next identity. She’s no stranger to wealth or
   danger, but the glitter of New York’s Gilded Age hides a darkness even
   she has never imagined. Here, the city’s elite maintain their grip
   through opulent balls, whispered rituals, and marriages with demons
   hungry for human devotion.
   When she crosses paths with the formidable matriarch of the Howard
   family, Judith is offered an irresistible bargain: to take the place of
   a missing debutante in the coming season. With Miss Iphigenia
   Marshall’s face stitched over her own, Judith becomes white, rich, and
   ready to risk it all. If she can hold onto her charm, her wits, and her
   life, her reward will be a husband with undreamt-of power.
   But in a world ruled by appetite and ambition, the most dangerous
   hunger of all might be her own.

   The Thrice-Bound Fool by Christopher Buehlman - Oct 13, 2026
   Official Blurb: Professional thief and inveterate trickster Kinch Na
   Shannack has always enjoyed a good book. But now his life, and the
   future of all of Manreach, depends on him deciphering a very bad book
   indeed; a stolen, sentient tome that tries to kill him every time he
   opens it-and often when it's closed.
   Galva, veteran of the goblin wars and death's sworn handmaiden, has
   vowed to protect Kinch while he mines the book for its dark magic and
   even darker secrets. She does so not for Kinch's sake-though the cheeky
   bastard is growing on her-but because the book is the key to stopping
   the shadowy tyrants out to kill the queen she serves, and loves.
   The ruthless, all-seeing Taker's Guild dogs their every step, and thief
   and knight must flee the known world entirely if they hope to succeed
   in their mission. But trouble finds Kinch wherever he goes, and the
   pair may have traded the devil they know for horrors far darker and
   hungrier as they enter lands unknown.
