Top Ten Tuesday : Fantasy Books You’d Be a Fool Not to Read

   Top Ten Tuesday was created by The Broke and the Bookish in June of
   2010 and was moved to That Artsy Reader Girl in January of 2018. It was
   born of a love of lists, a love of books, and a desire to bring bookish
   friends together.


   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;
   Green Rider by Kristen Britain; The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley;
   Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

   I heard so many good things about The Priory of the Orange Tree that I
   was afraid that it couldn’t possibly live up to the hype for me, but it
   blew me away. I’ve read it multiple times and will probably read it
   again in the future, especially since more books in the series have
   been announced (I’m ecstatic). You can read my full review here.


3. The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart

   This book is one of the few that I consider absolute perfection. A
   powerful current of mystery and horror runs through this fast paced
   book and it has everything from adorable creatures, antiheroes, and
   powerful female characters. You can read my full review here.


4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
   world-building. You can read my full review here.


5. Godkiller by Hannah Kaner

   I didn’t know how I would like a story that featured a Godkiller. It
   sounded a lot like The Witcher, but boy, am I glad I gave it a chance.
   This is another book that features an adorable creature, an antlered
   winged rabbit named Skedi, who just so happens to be the god of white
   lies. It also has great disability representation, epic battles, and
   philosophical questions. Full review here.


6. Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson

   This is another book that I’ve read multiple times and is just really
   dear to me. The novel follows Elisabeth, who’s something of a battle
   librarian, in a world where books are magical and have the potential to
   destroy the entire world. It takes place in a Victorian setting as well
   and is filled with sorcerers, demons, and most importantly, the magic
   of reading. Full review here.


7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his
   childhood, when his family, a traveling troupe of performers, is
   brutally massacred by creatures of legend. Full review here.


8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.


9. The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley

   It’s been years since I’ve read this book, but it really left an
   impression on me as a younger reader. Though McKinley’s other work, The
   Hero and The Crown, has received a lot of praise, I always liked The
   Blue Sword better, personally. The Blue Sword is a young adult novel,
   but is definitely mature enough to be enjoyed by adults. The novel
   follows a young girl who feels like she’s never belonged and is
   kidnapped by a prince of a foreign land and how she learns to live in a
   different culture and comes into her own.


10. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

   I feel like this is a blatantly obvious choice, but there is nothing
   quite like Mistborn. The entire idea of the book revolves around the
   question of what would happen if the villain wins. Mistborn follows the
   fight against an all-powerful dictator that the protagonist had failed
   to stop previously. The novel demonstrates the dark side of heroes, a
   great student-teacher relationship, a complex heroine, and amazingly
   unique and intricate world-building. Full review here.



   What books are on your list of fantasy books you’d be a fool not to
   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

       I’m pretty sure Robin has read all of these. I have many on my TBR
       especially the Megan O’Keefe one.

       For someone who claims to love fantasy (me), the fact that I’ve
       only read ONE of these books is a bit embarassing… better get to
       reading

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book

   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.

2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

   I heard so many good things about The Priory of the Orange Tree that I
   was afraid that it couldn’t possibly live up to the hype for me, but it
   blew me away. I’ve read it multiple times and will probably read it
   again in the future, especially since more books in the series have

   powerful current of mystery and horror runs through this fast paced
   book and it has everything from adorable creatures, antiheroes, and
   powerful female characters. You can read my full review here.


4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
   world-building. You can read my full review here.


5. Godkiller by Hannah Kaner

   I didn’t know how I would like a story that featured a Godkiller. It
   sounded a lot like The Witcher, but boy, am I glad I gave it a chance.
   This is another book that features an adorable creature, an antlered
   winged rabbit named Skedi, who just so happens to be the god of white
   lies. It also has great disability representation, epic battles, and
   philosophical questions. Full review here.


6. Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson

   This is another book that I’ve read multiple times and is just really
   dear to me. The novel follows Elisabeth, who’s something of a battle
   librarian, in a world where books are magical and have the potential to
   destroy the entire world. It takes place in a Victorian setting as well
   and is filled with sorcerers, demons, and most importantly, the magic
   of reading. Full review here.


7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his
   childhood, when his family, a traveling troupe of performers, is
   brutally massacred by creatures of legend. Full review here.


8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.


9. The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley

   It’s been years since I’ve read this book, but it really left an
   impression on me as a younger reader. Though McKinley’s other work, The
   Hero and The Crown, has received a lot of praise, I always liked The
   Blue Sword better, personally. The Blue Sword is a young adult novel,
   but is definitely mature enough to be enjoyed by adults. The novel
   follows a young girl who feels like she’s never belonged and is
   kidnapped by a prince of a foreign land and how she learns to live in a
   different culture and comes into her own.


10. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

   I feel like this is a blatantly obvious choice, but there is nothing
   quite like Mistborn. The entire idea of the book revolves around the
   question of what would happen if the villain wins. Mistborn follows the
   fight against an all-powerful dictator that the protagonist had failed
   to stop previously. The novel demonstrates the dark side of heroes, a
   great student-teacher relationship, a complex heroine, and amazingly
   unique and intricate world-building. Full review here.



   What books are on your list of fantasy books you’d be a fool not to
   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

       For someone who claims to love fantasy (me), the fact that I’ve

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.

Top Ten Tuesday : Fantasy Books You’d Be a Fool Not to Read

   Top Ten Tuesday was created by The Broke and the Bookish in June of
   2010 and was moved to That Artsy Reader Girl in January of 2018. It was
   born of a love of lists, a love of books, and a desire to bring bookish
   friends together.


   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;
   Green Rider by Kristen Britain; The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley;
   Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

   I heard so many good things about The Priory of the Orange Tree that I
   was afraid that it couldn’t possibly live up to the hype for me, but it
   blew me away. I’ve read it multiple times and will probably read it
   again in the future, especially since more books in the series have
   been announced (I’m ecstatic). You can read my full review here.


3. The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart

   This book is one of the few that I consider absolute perfection. A
   powerful current of mystery and horror runs through this fast paced
   book and it has everything from adorable creatures, antiheroes, and
   powerful female characters. You can read my full review here.


4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of

   great student-teacher relationship, a complex heroine, and amazingly
   unique and intricate world-building. Full review here.



   What books are on your list of fantasy books you’d be a fool not to
   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

       For someone who claims to love fantasy (me), the fact that I’ve
       only read ONE of these books is a bit embarassing… better get to
       reading

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.

Top Ten Tuesday : Fantasy Books You’d Be a Fool Not to Read

   Top Ten Tuesday was created by The Broke and the Bookish in June of
   2010 and was moved to That Artsy Reader Girl in January of 2018. It was
   born of a love of lists, a love of books, and a desire to bring bookish
   friends together.


   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;
   Green Rider by Kristen Britain; The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley;
   Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

   I heard so many good things about The Priory of the Orange Tree that I
   was afraid that it couldn’t possibly live up to the hype for me, but it
   blew me away. I’ve read it multiple times and will probably read it
   again in the future, especially since more books in the series have
   been announced (I’m ecstatic). You can read my full review here.


3. The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart

   This book is one of the few that I consider absolute perfection. A
   powerful current of mystery and horror runs through this fast paced
   book and it has everything from adorable creatures, antiheroes, and
   powerful female characters. You can read my full review here.


4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
   world-building. You can read my full review here.


5. Godkiller by Hannah Kaner

   I didn’t know how I would like a story that featured a Godkiller. It
   sounded a lot like The Witcher, but boy, am I glad I gave it a chance.
   This is another book that features an adorable creature, an antlered
   winged rabbit named Skedi, who just so happens to be the god of white
   lies. It also has great disability representation, epic battles, and
   philosophical questions. Full review here.


6. Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson

   This is another book that I’ve read multiple times and is just really
   dear to me. The novel follows Elisabeth, who’s something of a battle
   librarian, in a world where books are magical and have the potential to
   destroy the entire world. It takes place in a Victorian setting as well
   and is filled with sorcerers, demons, and most importantly, the magic
   of reading. Full review here.


7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his
   childhood, when his family, a traveling troupe of performers, is
   brutally massacred by creatures of legend. Full review here.


8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.


9. The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley

   It’s been years since I’ve read this book, but it really left an
   impression on me as a younger reader. Though McKinley’s other work, The
   Hero and The Crown, has received a lot of praise, I always liked The
   Blue Sword better, personally. The Blue Sword is a young adult novel,
   but is definitely mature enough to be enjoyed by adults. The novel
   follows a young girl who feels like she’s never belonged and is
   kidnapped by a prince of a foreign land and how she learns to live in a
   different culture and comes into her own.


10. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

   I feel like this is a blatantly obvious choice, but there is nothing
   quite like Mistborn. The entire idea of the book revolves around the
   question of what would happen if the villain wins. Mistborn follows the
   fight against an all-powerful dictator that the protagonist had failed
   to stop previously. The novel demonstrates the dark side of heroes, a
   great student-teacher relationship, a complex heroine, and amazingly
   unique and intricate world-building. Full review here.



   What books are on your list of fantasy books you’d be a fool not to
   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

            So many books, so little time. 🤭 I hope you enjoy them if you
            get to reading any of them!

       If you haven’t discovered Lois McMaster Bujold, please seek out her
       work. She has successfully created 3 different series; 1 science
       fiction and 2 fantasy. The Sharing Knife is a quartet with a follow
       up novel. The World of Five Gods has novels and novellas. All of
       them are wonderful.

Top Ten Tuesday : Fantasy Books You’d Be a Fool Not to Read

   Top Ten Tuesday was created by The Broke and the Bookish in June of
   2010 and was moved to That Artsy Reader Girl in January of 2018. It was
   born of a love of lists, a love of books, and a desire to bring bookish
   friends together.


   In honor of April Fool’s day this week’s theme is Books You’d be a Fool
   Not to Read. Since I primarily read fantasy novels, I’ve decided to
   focus on my favorite fantasy books that I think should be on everyone’s
   shelves or TBR lists. So without further ado, here’s my list of fantasy
   books you’d be a fool not to read.



FANTASY BOOKS YOU’D BE A FOOL NOT TO READ

   Fantasy Books You'd Be a Fool Not to read: The Way of Kings by Brandon
   Sanderson; Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon; The Bone
   Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart; Godkiller by Hannah Kaner; Sorcery of
   Thorns by Margarey Rogerson; The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss;
   Green Rider by Kristen Britain; The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley;
   Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

1. The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson

   Many years ago, I distinctly remembering that I wanted to read a book
   in the vein of a Final Fantasy game. I wanted a group of unlikely
   heroes facing down a god and saving the world against all the odds. I
   stumbled across The Way of Kings in a used bookstore and took it home.
   I was completely addicted and wondered why I hadn’t been reading
   fantasy books all along. This was the book that changed it all for me
   and made me a fantasy reader. Full review here.


2. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon

   I heard so many good things about The Priory of the Orange Tree that I
   was afraid that it couldn’t possibly live up to the hype for me, but it
   blew me away. I’ve read it multiple times and will probably read it
   again in the future, especially since more books in the series have
   been announced (I’m ecstatic). You can read my full review here.


3. The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart

   This book is one of the few that I consider absolute perfection. A
   powerful current of mystery and horror runs through this fast paced
   book and it has everything from adorable creatures, antiheroes, and
   powerful female characters. You can read my full review here.


4. The Blighted Stars by Meghan E. O’Keefe

   So, technically, this is a science fiction novel, but for the sakes of
   this list, we will consider it space fantasy, okay? The blurb of this
   book was really intriguing, and though I generally prefer fantasy, I
   decided to give the book a shot. I was blown away by the portrayal of
   an excellent enemies-to-lovers romance, the horrors of technology gone
   wrong, action scenes, a badass female protagonist, and unique
   world-building. You can read my full review here.


5. Godkiller by Hannah Kaner

   I didn’t know how I would like a story that featured a Godkiller. It
   sounded a lot like The Witcher, but boy, am I glad I gave it a chance.
   This is another book that features an adorable creature, an antlered
   winged rabbit named Skedi, who just so happens to be the god of white
   lies. It also has great disability representation, epic battles, and
   philosophical questions. Full review here.


6. Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson

   This is another book that I’ve read multiple times and is just really
   dear to me. The novel follows Elisabeth, who’s something of a battle
   librarian, in a world where books are magical and have the potential to
   destroy the entire world. It takes place in a Victorian setting as well
   and is filled with sorcerers, demons, and most importantly, the magic
   of reading. Full review here.


7. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss

   I know everyone who is into fantasy has probably already read this
   book, but if by some chance you haven’t, you need to do so immediately.
   The story is told from the perspective of an infamous kingkiller
   telling his never-before-told life story. His story begins with his
   childhood, when his family, a traveling troupe of performers, is
   brutally massacred by creatures of legend. Full review here.


8. Green Rider by Kristen Britain

   This book has all the bases of fantasy covered—evil mages, deadly magic
   forests, elves, supernaturally intelligent horses, a doomed romance,
   and a strong female protagonist who finds herself thrust into the
   position to save the world. Full review here.


9. The Blue Sword by Robin McKinley

   It’s been years since I’ve read this book, but it really left an
   impression on me as a younger reader. Though McKinley’s other work, The
   Hero and The Crown, has received a lot of praise, I always liked The
   Blue Sword better, personally. The Blue Sword is a young adult novel,
   but is definitely mature enough to be enjoyed by adults. The novel
   follows a young girl who feels like she’s never belonged and is
   kidnapped by a prince of a foreign land and how she learns to live in a
   different culture and comes into her own.


10. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

   I feel like this is a blatantly obvious choice, but there is nothing
   quite like Mistborn. The entire idea of the book revolves around the
   question of what would happen if the villain wins. Mistborn follows the
   fight against an all-powerful dictator that the protagonist had failed
   to stop previously. The novel demonstrates the dark side of heroes, a
   great student-teacher relationship, a complex heroine, and amazingly
   unique and intricate world-building. Full review here.



   What books are on your list of fantasy books you’d be a fool not to
   read? I’d love to add them to my TBR!

       I’m pretty sure Robin has read all of these. I have many on my TBR
       especially the Megan O’Keefe one.
