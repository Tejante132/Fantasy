2025 Fantasy Football: Week 15 Start ‘Em, Sit ‘Em, Picks And Busts

   December 9, 2025December 9, 2025 Joe Serpico Fantasy Football, Fantasy
   Football Advice, Fantasy football sleepers, fantasy football start em
   sit em, fantasy football week 15
   Dylan Sampson

   Let’s dive into some news and notes around the league, my top fantasy
   plays and favorite picks for Week 15.

   Notes:

   • If you made it to the fantasy football playoffs, congratulations! If
   you did not, hopefully your league still has something to play for. If
   you finished in last place, take the punishment without any issues.

   • The injury bug was back in Week 15, and it could not have come at a
   worse time for fantasy owners. Daniel Jones is currently QB10 but is
   now out for the season with an Achilles injury. Jayden Daniels was a
   surprise return to the lineup for the Commanders but was forced out in
   the second half in Minnesota. CeeDee Lamb, Tee Higgins and De’Von
   Achane were all knocked out of action. Zach Ertz likely saw the end of
   his terrific career with a knee injury. As always, check my player
   rankings for the best available players.

   • The biggest unknown this time of the year is whether fantasy stars
   will get benched to rest for the playoffs. The Bills-Patriots matchup
   this weekend could have implications that could lead to this very
   scenario. This is something to keep a track of the next couple of
   weeks. It is plausible that Drake Maye is not an option for fantasy
   owners in Week 17.

   • Remember to check the weather heading into Sunday for your kicker
   selection. Target kickers playing in domes and fair weather conditions.
   Every point matters this time of the year.

2025 Fantasy Football: Week 15 Start ‘Em, Sit ‘Em, Picks And Busts

   December 9, 2025December 9, 2025 Joe Serpico Fantasy Football, Fantasy
   Football Advice, Fantasy football sleepers, fantasy football start em
   sit em, fantasy football week 15
   Dylan Sampson

   Let’s dive into some news and notes around the league, my top fantasy
   plays and favorite picks for Week 15.

   Notes:

   • If you made it to the fantasy football playoffs, congratulations! If
   you did not, hopefully your league still has something to play for. If
   you finished in last place, take the punishment without any issues.

   • The injury bug was back in Week 15, and it could not have come at a
   worse time for fantasy owners. Daniel Jones is currently QB10 but is
   now out for the season with an Achilles injury. Jayden Daniels was a
   surprise return to the lineup for the Commanders but was forced out in
   the second half in Minnesota. CeeDee Lamb, Tee Higgins and De’Von
   Achane were all knocked out of action. Zach Ertz likely saw the end of
   his terrific career with a knee injury. As always, check my player
   rankings for the best available players.

   • The biggest unknown this time of the year is whether fantasy stars
   will get benched to rest for the playoffs. The Bills-Patriots matchup
   this weekend could have implications that could lead to this very
   scenario. This is something to keep a track of the next couple of
   weeks. It is plausible that Drake Maye is not an option for fantasy
   owners in Week 17.

   • Remember to check the weather heading into Sunday for your kicker
   selection. Target kickers playing in domes and fair weather conditions.
   Every point matters this time of the year.

   Thursday Night Game: Falcons vs. Buccaneers
   Sunday Night Game: Vikings vs. Cowboys
   Monday Night Game: Dolphins vs. Steelers

Start ‘Em:

   Quarterback: Marcus Mariota
   Running Back: Devin Singletary
   Wide Receiver: Jauan Jennings
   Tight End: Harold Fannin Jr.
   Defense: Panthers

Sit ‘Em:

   Quarterback: Tua Tagovailoa
   Running Back: Tony Pollard
   Wide Receiver: Troy Franklin
   Tight End: Mark Andrews
   Defense: Rams

Sleepers:

   Quarterback: Tyler Shough

   Wide Receiver: Andre Iosivas
   Tight End: Gunnar Helm

2025 Fantasy Football: Week 15 Start ‘Em, Sit ‘Em, Picks And Busts

   December 9, 2025December 9, 2025 Joe Serpico Fantasy Football, Fantasy
   Football Advice, Fantasy football sleepers, fantasy football start em
   sit em, fantasy football week 15
   Dylan Sampson

   Let’s dive into some news and notes around the league, my top fantasy
   plays and favorite picks for Week 15.

   Notes:

   • If you made it to the fantasy football playoffs, congratulations! If
   you did not, hopefully your league still has something to play for. If
   you finished in last place, take the punishment without any issues.

   • The injury bug was back in Week 15, and it could not have come at a
   worse time for fantasy owners. Daniel Jones is currently QB10 but is
   now out for the season with an Achilles injury. Jayden Daniels was a
   surprise return to the lineup for the Commanders but was forced out in
   the second half in Minnesota. CeeDee Lamb, Tee Higgins and De’Von
   Achane were all knocked out of action. Zach Ertz likely saw the end of
   his terrific career with a knee injury. As always, check my player
   rankings for the best available players.

   • The biggest unknown this time of the year is whether fantasy stars
   will get benched to rest for the playoffs. The Bills-Patriots matchup
   this weekend could have implications that could lead to this very
   scenario. This is something to keep a track of the next couple of
   weeks. It is plausible that Drake Maye is not an option for fantasy
   owners in Week 17.

   • Remember to check the weather heading into Sunday for your kicker
   selection. Target kickers playing in domes and fair weather conditions.
   Every point matters this time of the year.

   Thursday Night Game: Falcons vs. Buccaneers
   Sunday Night Game: Vikings vs. Cowboys
   Monday Night Game: Dolphins vs. Steelers

   • The biggest unknown this time of the year is whether fantasy stars
   will get benched to rest for the playoffs. The Bills-Patriots matchup
   this weekend could have implications that could lead to this very
   scenario. This is something to keep a track of the next couple of
   weeks. It is plausible that Drake Maye is not an option for fantasy
   owners in Week 17.

   • Remember to check the weather heading into Sunday for your kicker
   selection. Target kickers playing in domes and fair weather conditions.
   Every point matters this time of the year.
