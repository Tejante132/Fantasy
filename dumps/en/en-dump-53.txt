Abstract

   Research suggests individuals import real-world facts into fictional
   worlds based on the type of fact and fictional context. We examined the
   importation of real-world morality across fictional contexts.
   Undergraduate (Study 1) and MTurk (Study 2) participants were randomly
   assigned to read either a realistic or matching fantastical interactive
   narrative. At seven junctions, participants were presented with a
   choice between behaving morally and behaving immorally to advance their
   goals. In Study 3, an MTurk sample judged the actions of a character
   who behaved immorally. For Study 1, a gender by condition interaction
   was found, with males electing more immoral actions in the fantasy
   condition. For Study 2, no such effect was found. Nonetheless, in Study
   3, participants judged immoral actions in the realistic condition as
   more immoral compared to the fantasy context. Across all studies,
   transportation predicted choosing fewer immoral actions and judging
   immoral actions more harshly.

Abstract

   Research suggests individuals import real-world facts into fictional
   worlds based on the type of fact and fictional context. We examined the
   importation of real-world morality across fictional contexts.
   Undergraduate (Study 1) and MTurk (Study 2) participants were randomly
   assigned to read either a realistic or matching fantastical interactive
   narrative. At seven junctions, participants were presented with a
   choice between behaving morally and behaving immorally to advance their
   goals. In Study 3, an MTurk sample judged the actions of a character
   who behaved immorally. For Study 1, a gender by condition interaction
   was found, with males electing more immoral actions in the fantasy
   condition. For Study 2, no such effect was found. Nonetheless, in Study
   3, participants judged immoral actions in the realistic condition as
   more immoral compared to the fantasy context. Across all studies,
   transportation predicted choosing fewer immoral actions and judging
   immoral actions more harshly.
