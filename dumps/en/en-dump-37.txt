Music and Fantasy in Perfect Harmony

   By William Blanc

   In films or novels, music accompanies fantasy everywhere. Many
   composers, in turn, have immersed themselves in the genre, from film
   music to rock, rap and metal.

   The ballad, a medieval lyrical and musical genre, came back into
   fashion at the beginning of the 19th century with the advent of
   medievalism and poems such as La Belle Dame sans Merci (1819) by John
   Keats. The term evokes both children's songs and popular compositions,
   which go back to a past that is poorly identified but still perceived
   as archaic, and which romantic authors and scholars would
   enjoy composing. This is the case of Walter Scott (Minstrelsy of the
   Scottish Border, 1802), who refers us to the literary archetype of the
   wandering minstrel, as the "Troubadour Style" spread to painting in
   19th-century France. We also find ballad in the noun "baladine", a
   traveller whom the reader accompanies to a faraway, imaginary and
   enchanted universe. So it is not surprising that fantasy, heir
   to English medievalism, is a genre imbued with music.

Tolkien and Music

   J.R.R. Tolkien punctuates his characters' travels with song, evoking
   both times of old – that of the elves in "The Fall of Gil-galad" (The
   Brotherhood of the Ring, 1954) – but also the long march of his heroes
   towards the unknown ("The Road Goes Ever On", in The Hobbit). Tolkien
   later explains that his imaginary world was created by a song, a
   wonderful music pronounced by divine beings, the Ainur. Their voices,
   he tells us in The Silmarillon, "like unto harps and lutes, and pipes
   and trumpets, and viols and organs, and like unto countless choirs
   singing with words, began to fashion the theme of Iluvatar to a great
   music". The image invokes a classical symphony orchestra capable of
   conferring an epic dimension on a composition.


   Tolkien's songs, as well as the maps and illustrations he produced,
   give the imaginary world of Middle-earth a depth that allows readers to
   completely immerse themselves in it. They were quickly set to music, as
   early as 1967, during the author's lifetime, in an LP entitled Poems
   and Songs of Middle Earth, in which we hear not only Tolkien reciting
   some of his verses, but also interpretations of his songs by an opera
   singer, William Elvin. This record was one of the first examples of
   multimedia fantasy creation, where, in response to demand by curious
   fans, sound and visual elements are added to a literary fantasy world
   (illustrations, notably through calendars), a process that naturally
   leads to the staging of film or television versions.

Progressive Rock and Counterculture

   As a genre full of references to music, fantasy would quickly influence
   composers, particularly those of the protest generation of the 1960s,
   who saw in Tolkien's works, and more broadly in magical medievalism, an
   instrument for criticizing the contemporary industrial and military
   world. Leonard Nimoy, star of the television series Star Trek, played
   "The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins" in 1967. In England, Tolkien's influence
   was first noticed among "folk" musicians, a genre that tends to
   reproduce popular past sounds. From 1968 onwards, one of the members of
   the band Tyrannosaurus Rex adopted the stage name Steve Peregrin Took,
   alluding to one of the four hobbits of The Lord of the Rings. In 1970,
   he founded his own band, Shagrat, a name that this time referred to an
   orca from Tolkien's trilogy.

   Peregrin Took (1970)

   But it was progressive rock musicians who would draw their inspiration
   from fantasy the most. This musical genre is constructed like a
   psychedelic journey far from contemporary reality, a "trip" often
   triggered by the use of hallucinogenic drugs. It is thus made up of
   long pieces evoking imaginary worlds. The title of leading progressive
   rock band Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
   (1967), was a direct reference to Kenneth Grahame's youth fantasy novel
   The Wind in the Willows (1908). The characters in the story,
   anthropomorphic animals, see the god Pan playing a piece on his flute
   at dawn. This scene, a favorite of Sid Barrett, singer of Pink Floyd
   and close friend of Steve Peregrin Took, epitomizes the psychedelic
   genre. The music here goes hand in hand with a return to a childlike
   time, a (re)birth (the dawn) in a rural, animal and magical dream, far
   from the modern world. "The Gnome", one of the tracks of The Piper at
   the Gates of Dawn, evokes a small people living in a land of Cocaigne,
   like the Hobbits in Tolkien's Shire.

   The popularity of magical themes in progressive rock would later
   inspire metal musicians and songwriters, who like fantasy writers,
   plunge their audience into a medieval fantasy world.

Symphony and Epic Music

   At the same time, fantasy quickly began producing original tracks,
   especially for feature films and associated video games. Many of these
   works resembled compositions for opera, especially those by Richard
   Wagner, which are still a reference today, or for symphony orchestras,
   such as the soundtrack of the film Conan the Barbarian (1982) by Basil
   Poledouris. These songs have become so popular that they have been
   adapted for performances in concert halls, as is the case for example
   with the soundtrack of Star Wars (composed by John Williams) or that of
   The Lord of the Rings trilogy (written by Howard Shore). One of the
   most remarkable examples is undoubtedly Koji Kondo's music for the
   video game The Legend of Zelda (1986). Produced at the time with
   synthesizers to run on the first consoles, it was rewritten for a
   classical orchestra, and toured the world several times to celebrate
   the game's 25th anniversary. This phenomenon shows both the fascination
   of an audience of adult fans for the adventurous and imaginary ballads
   of their childhood, but also the increasing acceptance of fantasy in
   society. Thereafter, these productions were performed in symphony halls
   that are more associated with a legitimate, bourgeois and learned
   culture.

   The popularity of fantasy at the beginning of the 21st century
   continued to influence artists in popular musical genres, especially in
   those who until then had taken little inspiration from medieval magic.
   This imaginary world referred to a theme that was too "Europe-centered"
   and not conducive to arousing interest in the poor neighborhoods of
   large Western cities where many people from the African continent or
   the Middle East live. However, from the 1990s onwards, the image of the
   medievalist warrior, particularly Chinese warriors, fascinated certain
   hip-hop artists and rappers, such as the Wu-Tang Clan with their album
   Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) released in 1993, or the French artist
   Shurik'N with his song "Samurai" (1998). This music quickly became
   imbued with fantasy and albums, such as L'École du micro d'argent
   (1997) by the French group IAM, made direct reference to the genre.
   Shortly after the release of the Game of Thrones series, this
   fascination led to the publication on the Internet of two mixtapes
   entitled Catch The Throne (2014 and 2015), in which famous figures of
   American rap appear: Common, Wale, Snoop Dogg, and Method Man (a member
   of the Wu-Tang Clan).

Rap and Social Mobility

   With hip-hop, it is not so much the magical journey that is imagined,
   but the epic nature of the bloody battles of The Game of Thrones, and
   the possibility of imagining oneself in a fictional world, having made
   it to the top of the social ladder at the cost of great danger. These
   stories inspire rappers, who see it as an echo of their own journey
   from the slums of big American cities to fame and fortune. We find this
   idea not only in Wale's "King Slayer" ("I'm a Lannister," he shouts,
   "[I] run my town, that's Seven Kingdoms"), but also in "Parti de rien",
   a song composed by Sofiane, a rapper from Stains in Seine-Saint-Denis.
   Accompanying the French release of Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of
   the Sword (2017) (a version of the Camelot myth strongly marked by
   fantasy), the song begins as follows: "Lift up the street, as you would
   lift up the Grail".

   Female rappers have also taken this idea on board, adding a gendered
   dimension to it. Snow Tha Product, in Catch the Throne, thus compares
   herself to Daenerys Targaryen, a queen who must impose herself in a
   male world. The music here echoes the significant feminization of the
   genre, with more and more female heroines and authors now in the
   spotlight.

   singing with words, began to fashion the theme of Iluvatar to a great
   music". The image invokes a classical symphony orchestra capable of
   conferring an epic dimension on a composition.


   Tolkien's songs, as well as the maps and illustrations he produced,
   give the imaginary world of Middle-earth a depth that allows readers to
   completely immerse themselves in it. They were quickly set to music, as
   early as 1967, during the author's lifetime, in an LP entitled Poems
   and Songs of Middle Earth, in which we hear not only Tolkien reciting
   some of his verses, but also interpretations of his songs by an opera
   singer, William Elvin. This record was one of the first examples of
   multimedia fantasy creation, where, in response to demand by curious
   fans, sound and visual elements are added to a literary fantasy world
   (illustrations, notably through calendars), a process that naturally
   leads to the staging of film or television versions.

Progressive Rock and Counterculture

   As a genre full of references to music, fantasy would quickly influence
   composers, particularly those of the protest generation of the 1960s,
   who saw in Tolkien's works, and more broadly in magical medievalism, an
   instrument for criticizing the contemporary industrial and military
   world. Leonard Nimoy, star of the television series Star Trek, played
   "The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins" in 1967. In England, Tolkien's influence
   was first noticed among "folk" musicians, a genre that tends to
   reproduce popular past sounds. From 1968 onwards, one of the members of
   the band Tyrannosaurus Rex adopted the stage name Steve Peregrin Took,
   alluding to one of the four hobbits of The Lord of the Rings. In 1970,
   he founded his own band, Shagrat, a name that this time referred to an
   orca from Tolkien's trilogy.

   But it was progressive rock musicians who would draw their inspiration
   from fantasy the most. This musical genre is constructed like a
   psychedelic journey far from contemporary reality, a "trip" often
   triggered by the use of hallucinogenic drugs. It is thus made up of
   long pieces evoking imaginary worlds. The title of leading progressive
   rock band Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn
   (1967), was a direct reference to Kenneth Grahame's youth fantasy novel
   The Wind in the Willows (1908). The characters in the story,
   anthropomorphic animals, see the god Pan playing a piece on his flute
   at dawn. This scene, a favorite of Sid Barrett, singer of Pink Floyd
   and close friend of Steve Peregrin Took, epitomizes the psychedelic
   genre. The music here goes hand in hand with a return to a childlike
   time, a (re)birth (the dawn) in a rural, animal and magical dream, far
   from the modern world. "The Gnome", one of the tracks of The Piper at
   the Gates of Dawn, evokes a small people living in a land of Cocaigne,
   like the Hobbits in Tolkien's Shire.

   The popularity of magical themes in progressive rock would later
   inspire metal musicians and songwriters, who like fantasy writers,
   plunge their audience into a medieval fantasy world.

Symphony and Epic Music

   At the same time, fantasy quickly began producing original tracks,
   especially for feature films and associated video games. Many of these
   works resembled compositions for opera, especially those by Richard
   Wagner, which are still a reference today, or for symphony orchestras,
   such as the soundtrack of the film Conan the Barbarian (1982) by Basil
   Poledouris. These songs have become so popular that they have been
   adapted for performances in concert halls, as is the case for example
   with the soundtrack of Star Wars (composed by John Williams) or that of
   The Lord of the Rings trilogy (written by Howard Shore). One of the
   most remarkable examples is undoubtedly Koji Kondo's music for the
   video game The Legend of Zelda (1986). Produced at the time with
   synthesizers to run on the first consoles, it was rewritten for a
   classical orchestra, and toured the world several times to celebrate
   the game's 25th anniversary. This phenomenon shows both the fascination
   of an audience of adult fans for the adventurous and imaginary ballads
   of their childhood, but also the increasing acceptance of fantasy in
   society. Thereafter, these productions were performed in symphony halls
   that are more associated with a legitimate, bourgeois and learned
   culture.

   The popularity of fantasy at the beginning of the 21st century
   continued to influence artists in popular musical genres, especially in
   those who until then had taken little inspiration from medieval magic.
   This imaginary world referred to a theme that was too "Europe-centered"
   and not conducive to arousing interest in the poor neighborhoods of
   large Western cities where many people from the African continent or
   the Middle East live. However, from the 1990s onwards, the image of the
   medievalist warrior, particularly Chinese warriors, fascinated certain
   hip-hop artists and rappers, such as the Wu-Tang Clan with their album
   Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) released in 1993, or the French artist
   Shurik'N with his song "Samurai" (1998). This music quickly became
   imbued with fantasy and albums, such as L'École du micro d'argent
   (1997) by the French group IAM, made direct reference to the genre.
   Shortly after the release of the Game of Thrones series, this
   fascination led to the publication on the Internet of two mixtapes
   entitled Catch The Throne (2014 and 2015), in which famous figures of
   American rap appear: Common, Wale, Snoop Dogg, and Method Man (a member
   of the Wu-Tang Clan).

Rap and Social Mobility

   With hip-hop, it is not so much the magical journey that is imagined,
   but the epic nature of the bloody battles of The Game of Thrones, and
   the possibility of imagining oneself in a fictional world, having made
   it to the top of the social ladder at the cost of great danger. These
   stories inspire rappers, who see it as an echo of their own journey
   from the slums of big American cities to fame and fortune. We find this
   idea not only in Wale's "King Slayer" ("I'm a Lannister," he shouts,
   "[I] run my town, that's Seven Kingdoms"), but also in "Parti de rien",
   a song composed by Sofiane, a rapper from Stains in Seine-Saint-Denis.
   Accompanying the French release of Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of
   the Sword (2017) (a version of the Camelot myth strongly marked by
   fantasy), the song begins as follows: "Lift up the street, as you would
   lift up the Grail".

   Female rappers have also taken this idea on board, adding a gendered
   dimension to it. Snow Tha Product, in Catch the Throne, thus compares
   herself to Daenerys Targaryen, a queen who must impose herself in a
   male world. The music here echoes the significant feminization of the
   genre, with more and more female heroines and authors now in the
   spotlight.
