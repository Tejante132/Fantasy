What Are Fantasy Sports?

   Right out of the gate, to avoid confusion, the term manager will
   describe a person participating in a fantasy sport while a player will
   describe the professional athletes whose performance you are following.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It’s the 21st century, so to define “fantasy sports”, let’s take to the
   internet, specifically everyone’s favorite research starting point –
   Wikipedia:

     A fantasy sport is a type of online game where participants assemble
     imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.
     These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those
     players’ players in actual games. This performance is converted into
     points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected
     by each fantasy team’s manager. These point systems can be simple
     enough to be manually calculated by a “league commissioner” who
     coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be
     compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of
     the professional sport. In fantasy sports, team managers draft,
     trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.

   Being a fantasy sports manager is similar being a day trader in the
   stock market. Envision individual players as stocks. Your goal is to
   buy, sell, and trade your players in order to have the highest
   accumulated value at the end of the season.

   Where does “value” come from in fantasy sports? One word: statistics.
   In every sport, there are a multitude of stats that can be used to
   define an individual player’s level of performance. If you look at at a
   baseball box score, hits, RBIs, batting average, earned run average
   (ERA), and strikeouts are just a few commonly used stats that
   demonstrate how each player impacted the outcome of the game. Every
   other sport has similar stats: in football, a sampling includes rushing
   yards, touchdowns, interceptions thrown, and extra points kicked; in
   basketball, there are points, assists, turnovers, and blocks; in soccer
   and hockey, there are goals, assists, shutouts, and plus/minus. Not
   just scoring plays, but ALL statistics could have value in fantasy
   sports.

   Value is also governed by the rules of the market, the market being
   your fantasy sports league. Before the season starts, your league will
   agree to a set of scoring rules for how each player’s statistics will
   be counted. Based on the scoring rules chosen by the league, managers
   will then select a certain number of players to be on their teams,
   typically done by a draft. Any players that are not taken in the draft
   are free agents. (Check out our introductions to each fantasy sport to
   see specific scoring, draft, and free agent formats.)

   With a full team of players, you are now a fantasy sports manager!

   You have made an initial investment by drafting players onto your team.
   Once the season begins, you must begin to manage and evaluate your
   investments. Have your players been helping or hurting the value of
   your team based on your league’s scoring system? Are there any free
   agents that have been performing better that could help your team? What
   factors are affecting a player’s performance? These general questions
   are just a sampling of those that managers need to be constantly trying
   to find answers to. For certain players, you will be happy to buy and
   hold them all season. For others, you may determine it is in your best
   interest to drop them – making them free agents – and add another
   better performing player.

   You might make changes to your roster every single day; you might make
   them once a week; you might only make a few during the whole year. Your
   league’s rules and competitiveness will determine how active of a
   manager you need to be to be successful. The most fun leagues, though,
   are those in which every manager regularly participates in trying to
   improve their rosters.

   Fantasy sports offers a glimpse into what actual professional sports
   general managers value when they assemble and manage their teams. You
   becoming engaged to sports in a whole new level. Once you start
   playing. you will likely find yourself not just interested in the wins
   and losses of your chosen team, but also the individual performance of
   players throughout the league, perhaps even on your chosen team’s
   rival.

   Here at PFS, our goal is to emphasize that fantasy sports are meant to
   be friendly competitions, done for bragging rights more than anything
   else. We see an opportunity to increase the value of those bragging
   rights. What if, along with winning your league, you were able to say
   that you donated money to cause you care deeply about. That is exactly
   what PFS does: we bring people together to play fantasy sports and
   raise money for your favorite philanthropic organizations.

What Are Fantasy Sports?

   Right out of the gate, to avoid confusion, the term manager will
   describe a person participating in a fantasy sport while a player will
   describe the professional athletes whose performance you are following.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It’s the 21st century, so to define “fantasy sports”, let’s take to the
   internet, specifically everyone’s favorite research starting point –
   Wikipedia:

     A fantasy sport is a type of online game where participants assemble
     imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport.
     These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those
     players’ players in actual games. This performance is converted into
     points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected
     by each fantasy team’s manager. These point systems can be simple
     enough to be manually calculated by a “league commissioner” who
     coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be
     compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of
     the professional sport. In fantasy sports, team managers draft,
     trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports.

   Being a fantasy sports manager is similar being a day trader in the
   stock market. Envision individual players as stocks. Your goal is to
   buy, sell, and trade your players in order to have the highest
   accumulated value at the end of the season.

   Where does “value” come from in fantasy sports? One word: statistics.
   In every sport, there are a multitude of stats that can be used to
   define an individual player’s level of performance. If you look at at a
   baseball box score, hits, RBIs, batting average, earned run average
   (ERA), and strikeouts are just a few commonly used stats that
   demonstrate how each player impacted the outcome of the game. Every
   other sport has similar stats: in football, a sampling includes rushing
   yards, touchdowns, interceptions thrown, and extra points kicked; in
   basketball, there are points, assists, turnovers, and blocks; in soccer
   and hockey, there are goals, assists, shutouts, and plus/minus. Not
   just scoring plays, but ALL statistics could have value in fantasy
   sports.

   Value is also governed by the rules of the market, the market being
   your fantasy sports league. Before the season starts, your league will
   agree to a set of scoring rules for how each player’s statistics will
   be counted. Based on the scoring rules chosen by the league, managers
   will then select a certain number of players to be on their teams,
   typically done by a draft. Any players that are not taken in the draft
   are free agents. (Check out our introductions to each fantasy sport to
   see specific scoring, draft, and free agent formats.)

   With a full team of players, you are now a fantasy sports manager!

   You have made an initial investment by drafting players onto your team.
   Once the season begins, you must begin to manage and evaluate your
   investments. Have your players been helping or hurting the value of
   your team based on your league’s scoring system? Are there any free
   agents that have been performing better that could help your team? What
   factors are affecting a player’s performance? These general questions
   are just a sampling of those that managers need to be constantly trying
   to find answers to. For certain players, you will be happy to buy and
   hold them all season. For others, you may determine it is in your best
   interest to drop them – making them free agents – and add another
   better performing player.

   You might make changes to your roster every single day; you might make
   them once a week; you might only make a few during the whole year. Your
   league’s rules and competitiveness will determine how active of a
   manager you need to be to be successful. The most fun leagues, though,
   are those in which every manager regularly participates in trying to
   improve their rosters.

   Fantasy sports offers a glimpse into what actual professional sports
   general managers value when they assemble and manage their teams. You
   becoming engaged to sports in a whole new level. Once you start
   playing. you will likely find yourself not just interested in the wins
   and losses of your chosen team, but also the individual performance of
   players throughout the league, perhaps even on your chosen team’s
   rival.

   Here at PFS, our goal is to emphasize that fantasy sports are meant to
   be friendly competitions, done for bragging rights more than anything
   else. We see an opportunity to increase the value of those bragging
   rights. What if, along with winning your league, you were able to say
   that you donated money to cause you care deeply about. That is exactly
   what PFS does: we bring people together to play fantasy sports and
   raise money for your favorite philanthropic organizations.
