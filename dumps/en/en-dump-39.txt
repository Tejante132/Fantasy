The Depth and Wonder of Fantasy Music

   What is Fantasy Music, really? As a broad category, it describes
   musical pieces that transport the listener to an imaginary world. In
   this article, we want to present you the most amazing compositions
   we’ve discovered over the years. Of course, they were all great
   inspirations in writing our own Fantasy TV Series Black Forest Witch.

     Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? /
     Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
     Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody

   If you research the topic of Fantasy, you will discover a lot of books,
   games, movies and TV series easily. Music probably doesn’t even come to
   your mind when you think about the question what’s to be considered
   fantastical. However, there’s a tight connection between the two that
   might not be obvious at first glance: On the one hand, music plays an
   important part in the world-building, tone and atmosphere of Fantasy
   Movies and all other media that utilize moving images. In a sense, it
   supports them in creating this otherworldly feeling in the audience. On
   the other hand, music can stand entirely on its own. Music is an
   artform that works without any words, and that makes it a mystical
   phenomenon in its own right.

Subcategories of Fantasy Music

   Fantasy Music relates to Fantasy Art, as they are both broad
   categories, formed from a very modern understanding of media. Both
   comprise a variety of different styles from different epochs. Here are
   some of the main categories that we think are relevant today:

Ancient & Middle Ages Music

   These musical pieces are callbacks to historial times that shaped our
   modern society. While they reference those times, they don’t try to
   replicate them – that’s where the Fantastical comes in. For the most
   part, they don’t use the instruments, the harmonies or the melodies
   that people back then would have found beautiful. And it doesnt even
   matter. Their whole reason to exist is to evoke the feeling of
   travelling back there to those strange lands and cultures. Consider
   them to be inspired by historical events and characters.

Ancient Fantasy Music

   From Mesopotamia where the first human civilizations formed to the high
   middle ages in Europe, we can recognize a lot of different cultures. Of
   course, the oldest music was tribal in nature, heavy on drums and
   mostly based around rythms. This mix of Ancient Egyptian Music I still
   use while writing, as it relaxes and inspires me.

Celtic and Viking Music

   Celtic and Viking themes are at the heart of Fantasy Music. Both these
   cultures play a dominant role in the literary Fantasy genre: From the
   Norse Gods Odin and Thor to the story of King Arthur, the influence
   they still have is substantial. Often, they are named in the same
   breath, while being considerably different. For one, the Vikings were
   seafarers, the Celtics weren’t. The fact that modern Britains are the
   descendants of both cultures probably gives them an equally high
   standing today.

Medieval Fantasy Music

   The middle ages were considered the dark times in our history. That’s
   why there’s a lot of beauty, but also a lot of darkness to Medieval
   Music. And just as Knights, Courtship and being on adventures is still
   a Fantasy today, the Medieval Fantasy Music transports us there with
   its noble and festive sounds.

Epic Fantasy Music

   Epic Fantasy Music leans heavily into gaming. The player’s own actions
   demand the support of this engaging music. Of course, this soundtrack
   for the original Assassin’s Creed is also inspired by Medieval tunes:

Fantasy Metal

   Metal is very diverse. Fantasy Metal as a subcategory is closely linked
   with Fantasy Novels, as the songs further Fantasy as a narrative genre.
   The most well-known band featuring this category is probably the German
   Power Metal band Blind Guardian. Their The Bard’s Song is inspired
   heavily by the Middle Ages:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/n63UbX5kzAc?feature=oembed

     Tomorrow will take us away /
     Far from home /
     No one will ever know our names /
     But the bards’ songs will remain /
     Tomorrow will take it away /
     The fear of today /
     It will be gone /
     Due to our magic songs.
     Blind Guardian, The Bard’s Song

Fantasy Soundtracks

   Many great Fantasy Movies have also great soundtracks. One of my
   personal favorites is from the Science-Fiction Fantasy Film Tron:
   Legacy by the French electronic band Daft Punk:

Other Fantasy Music

   It could be argued that Music in itself is a Fantasy. Consider a simple
   composition like the Tropical House song Don’t be so shy by French
   pop-soul artist Imany – doesn’t this song invite us to a gorgeous
   Fantasy vacation at the beach, one that might never come? What about
   other songs like John Lennon’s Imagine, in which he sings of a world
   without borders and prejudice?

   The themes of escape from and return to the real world are quite
   common. It’s a great quality of music that’s fun and engages us as
   listeners. And I’m sure we will discover many great new artists and
   compositons in the years to come that give us this great feeling of
   companionship and empowerment that all Fantasy does.
