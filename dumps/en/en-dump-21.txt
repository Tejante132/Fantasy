25 of the Best Fantasy Books You Should Read Next

   [25bestfantasybooks.jpg]

   I know what it’s like: sometimes you finish a book and you just don’t
   know what to read next. That’s why I’ve put this list together of 25 of
   the best fantasy books (in no particular order) that should be at the
   top of your to-read list!

   And if you’re in the mood for science fiction instead, I’ve got a list
   for you too.

Assassin’s Apprentice

   Any list of the best fantasy books has to start with Assassin’s
   Apprentice! The beginning of the Farseer trilogy, and also the
   beginning of a nine book series that tells the life of Fitz, bastard
   son of a disgraced prince, and his remarkable, hidden role in history.

   Hobb’s Fitz books are very much a coming of age story, so if you’re a
   fan of tight action and lean prose, pass on this one. But if you like a
   fantasy book that enjoys its time with the world and it’s characters,
   take a look at Assassin’s Apprentice.

   Fitz is a great viewpoint character, flawed but full of good
   intentions, and he’s supported by a huge range of varied characters
   that are easy to love, and opposed by villains that are easy to hate.

   Although this is the beginning of a story that will take nine books to
   tell, don’t worry about getting sucked into a nine book series; the
   first trilogy stands alone. In fact, I think it’s the best of the
   three, although the second trilogy is very good too!

A Sorcerer Slain

   If you liked the sound of a murder mystery in a fantasy novel, but
   didn’t really want a fantasy-Sherlock Holmes, then A Sorcerer Slain is
   for you. It’s funny, action-packed, and clever. And perhaps the
   greatest praise I can heap upon this book is that the lead character
   and investigator, Lowmar Dashiel, thinks like a real person.

   The story is set in the city of Andruan, where the Sorcerer Supreme has
   been murdered (he would be the sorcerer slain). This act threatens to
   topple the king and spark a civil war. With so many interested parties,
   no-one can be above suspicion. But I’ve seen too many crime stories
   where someone always is; there’s always someone the hero never suspects
   for a moment, and it’s always them that did it. Always. But Dashiel
   suspects nearly everyone at one point or another and I wanted to
   applaud every time.

   This smart writing extends to the genre blending that takes place in
   this novel. When I first heard that Sivers was writing fantasy crime,
   my first thought was that those genres were unusual bedfellows. But A
   Sorcerer Slain is proof they make an excellent match; it calls no
   attention to itself, borrowing tropes from both fantasy and crime as it
   wills. At no point do these genres clash, and most of the time they’re
   perfectly balanced.

   In fact, the only thing that lets down this novel is when those genres
   become unbalanced, and it embraces the fantasy genre too strongly. For
   instance, there’s a great battle which on paper sounds great for a
   fantasy novel. But this book is smaller, more intimate, and the battle
   felt out of place to me. Once things had got back to Dashiel’s smaller
   world, things felt more natural.

   So if epic fantasy is the only kind of fantasy you’ll entertain, give
   this one a pass. But if you’re in the mood for something a little
   different, this crime fantasy might just scratch that itch.

Children of Blood and Bone

   If you’re tired of medieval-European fantasy, this is an excellent
   choice for your next read. Adeyemi has written a story of persecution,
   magic, and raw emotion that will catch you by surprise at times. This
   might be a YA novel, but it doesn’t pull any punches; alongside the
   smiles and the romance, there’s a lot of death, violence, and heartache
   too.

   Children of Blood and Bone tells the tale of Zélie Adebola, whose
   mother was killed when tyrannical King Saran ordered the deaths of all
   magic-wielding magi. Saran also severed the magi’s connection with the
   gods, and now magic is no more. After a chance encounter, Zélie leads a
   quest to bring magic back with the help of her brother, Tzain, and
   Saran’s daughter, Princess Amari. Standing in their way is Amari’s
   older brother, Prince Inan, but whether he is friend or foe is
   uncertain, and there is a strange connection between Inan and Zélie
   that might be more than it seems.

   Adeyemi’s novel moves at a pace, hammering through the story There’s a
   great sense of world, too. The Kingdom of Orisha feels huge, but
   there’s also a sense that there’s a big wide world beyond its borders.
   All of the characters have depth, too, and are full of the conflicts
   and uncertainties that make a character human. So much of the story
   hinges on these conflicting desires that I honestly wasn’t sure which
   way the story was going to go, which is always a good thing!

   Filled with character-driven, action-filled fantasy that differs from
   the usual medieval-European fare, and unexpectedly moving at
   times, Children of Blood and Bone really is one of the best fantasy
   books out there.

   Or, give it a listen: I got a copy of the audiobook for Children of
   Blood and Bone, and I can’t recommend enough experiencing the book this
   way. It’s beautifully narrated by Bahni Turpi, whose work is reason
   enough to pick up the audiobook instead!

The Lies of Locke Lamora

   I always think of The Lies of Locke Lamora as Ocean’s 11 meets epic
   fantasy. It’s not a perfect analogy; for instance, Scott Lynch’s novel
   doesn’t feature Don Cheadle gamely trying to squeeze as much Cockney
   rhyming slang into his dialogue as he can. But if you love a good heist
   but you like fantasy worlds too, this is the book for you.

   Locke Lamora is a member of the Gentlemen Bastards, a gang of thieves
   working under the leadership of Father Chains. They all find themselves
   wrapped up in the mysterious machinations of the Gray King, and the
   story is filled with twists, double crosses, and desperate races to
   save the day, not all of which are entirely successful.

   Locke is a witty, smooth-talking character, so don’t come to this novel
   for a gritty time. Yes, there’s violence, but there’s also jokes and
   hijinks too. The body count gets pretty high, and there’s even a bit of
   torture thrown in for good measure. But the general tone is less Game
   of Thrones and more, well, Ocean’s Eleven. It’s a good time, and a
   classic for a reason.

Ship of Magic

   Fresh off the back of the Farseer trilogy, Hobb wrote a new trilogy set
   in the same world, but with a very different setting.

   Where the Farseer trilogy dealt with magic and dragons, this new
   trilogy deals Liveships, ships made from wood imbued with magic that
   makes the ship come alive. These ships absorb the personalities of the
   people who have died on deck, which is a fascinating and slightly
   disturbing idea!

   If you read Assassin’s Apprentice and you weren’t a fan of the main
   character, Fitz, then give Ship of Magic a chance. It’s full of very
   different characters: a woman trying to become captain of a ship; a boy
   taken from his life training to be a priest; a pirate who would be
   king. Because it’s a book about ships; of course there are pirates!

   Hobb’s writing is as strong as ever, and there are some interesting,
   subtle links to her Fitz books for the eagle-eyed, but this trilogy
   stands apart from her other work.

Redwall

   Brian Jacques’ Redwall is the first in an epic fantasy series for
   children starring English woodland animals. It’s quaint and it’s sweet
   and it’s fun. It’s a fantastic introduction to fantasy for children or,
   if you’re an adult, it’s a great read between thick fantasy tomes.

   The eponymous Redwall is an abbey, populated by mice, which faces the
   threat of Cluny the Scourge, the appropriately named rat leader of an
   army curiously hell-bent on conquering the abbey. The hero, Mathias, is
   a young mouse who is always being told by his elders to be calm and
   mindful, but lusts for adventure and excitement. Naturally, it falls to
   him to somehow find a way to defend Redwall against the oncoming
   threat.

   There’s legendary warriors, an ancient sword, and riddles that will
   puzzle and please young minds (although quite how the logic works will
   puzzle older ones). Redwall should definitely be on your reading list,
   and is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy books around!

The Hobbit

   The Lord of the Rings gets all the hype and the glory, but I think The
   Hobbit is not just under-appreciated, but even (dare I say it) more
   deserving of a place on a list of the best fantasy books than it’s
   younger, bigger brother.

   Tolkien’s first major work benefits from being a sleeker, more focused
   thing. It’s not a big, sprawling epic, but an adventure story. A
   treasure hunt, in fact, with a dragon to vanquish and humorous events
   and coincidences along the way. The narrator has a knowing tone,
   sharing asides and commentary with the reader that are intended to
   delight and surprise. I’ve always had a soft spot for the invention of
   golf in Middle-Earth; this is accredited to a Took’s fortuitous
   decapitation of a goblin.

   The origin of golf sums up The Hobbit rather nicely, in fact. This is a
   fantasy adventure that isn’t meant to be taken too seriously. That
   doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high, or that there aren’t
   thrilling scenes and perilous moments. But this is fantasy without the
   grit and grime, so it’s perfect for when you need a spot of levity and
   adventure in your reading list.

Grendel

   This is a bit of a different one. If you like your fantasy full of
   adventure, give this one a miss. But if you’re in the mood for
   something contemplative, take a look at John C Gardner’s exploration of
   the monster Grendel.

   That’s somewhat misleading, in a sense, because there are times when
   this book feels less like an exploration of a character, and more that
   the character is simply a vehicle for an exploration of philosophy. In
   fact, there were times when reading Grendel that I wondered if Gardner
   was simply using the tropes of fantasy to write a philosophical
   treatise. Which feels unfair, because even in those moments I found
   myself enjoying the story.

   But that, in a sense, is why I always recommend Grendel, because it’s
   by no definition a standard fantasy novel. I won’t lie to you: once
   you’ve read it, you might not want to read something like it again. But
   fantasy is such a huge, wide genre that can encompass so many different
   stories. Grendel is a contemplative fantasy, and it’s a masterclass in
   taking what was a fairly nondescript monster (from Beowulf, if you
   weren’t sure), and turning it into something you can not only empathise
   with, but end up rooting for.

The Prince of Thorns

   You might have heard this before: dispossessed prince seeks to reclaim
   his throne. But it was something of as surprise to find that this
   prince was a bit of a monster.

   Lawrence certainly isn’t the first person to write an anti-hero, but I
   was surprised at how much I liked Jorg, even as he did some pretty
   unpleasant things. As is often the way, the anti-hero is saved by
   offering scathing yet honest opinions that no-one else will voice, as
   well as a minor and earnest romantic subplot. Sometimes, Jorg even
   commits decent acts, although almost by accident.

   I was also somewhat surprised to discover that this wasn’t a medieval
   fantasy, but instead a fantasy set in a far-off, post-apocalyptic
   world. Lawrence does a very good job of weaving in hints of this world
   without being heavy-handed, which I appreciated; all too often, such a
   setting is handled with the subtlety of a brick to the face.

   The only downside to The Prince of Thorns is that the ending is almost
   too neat for the first in a trilogy; the force driving you to read the
   next book isn’t really the plot, more just your enjoyment of reading
   this one. That’s hardly a terrible sin, but what can I say? I’m a
   sucker for a cliffhanger.

Spiderlight

   My relationship with Dungeons & Dragons was brief. In fact, I played a
   Dragon Quest once, and Warhammer Quest once. That’s it. But it was
   enough to familiarise me with the tropes, and so I took great joy in
   watching Adrian Tchaikovsky turn those tropes into a fun, engaging,
   thoughtful novel.

   The setup for Spiderlight is simple enough: the good guys are stalwart
   warriors of hope and faith, the bad guys are ugly and monstrous.
   Tchaikovsky turns that on its head pretty much straightaway. In fact,
   the idea that good guys aren’t always good and bad guys aren’t always
   bad runs through the entire novel.

   Unfortunately, that means that twists and surprises aren’t overly
   surprising. What was surprising was that I didn’t mind so much.
   Considering that much of Spiderlight feels like it’s based on D&D
   tropes, I was actually beginning to enjoy reading about the characters.
   This is a stand-alone novel, so there isn’t much room for the stakes to
   get to the usual dramatic heights of epic fantasy, but they felt high
   enough for an enjoyable read.

   And, while Spiderlight might not revolutionise the fantasy genre, I was
   too busy empathising with a creepy, giant spider to really notice.

Warbreaker

   To say that Brandon Sanderson is prolific is an understatement. While
   that’s great for his fans, sometimes a huge body of work can be
   somewhat intimidating. Where do you begin? Once you start, are you
   committing yourself to read dozens of books to get the full picture?
   What if you just want a taster to see if you like the author’s work
   before you dive in? Warbreaker is the taster you’ve been looking for.

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and
   such. I did, however, appreciate that the magic system creates what are
   essentially walking gods. One of them was even my favourite character;
   Lightsong is somewhat jaded and disconnected from his life of luxury,
   so he’s in the best position to make jokes and wry observations.
   Unfortunately, Lightsong’s story takes a while to get going, which
   creates an odd dissonance between his laconic existence and the more
   traditional fantasty antics of the other characters.

   But with a magic sword, a king to overthrow, and a few surprising
   twists and turns, this is definitely worth a read.

The Looking Glass Wars

   What is it about Alice in Wonderland that has led so many writers to
   reinterpret its story and themes? Whatever it is, Frank Beddor
   certainly has a fresh take on things.

   Take Alice in Wonderland and put it in the epic fantasy blender.
   There’s a lost princess whose throne has been usurped, a kingdom under
   a tyrant’s rule, and an assassin; yes, the Mad Hatter has become the
   Hatter Madigan, and he’s a badass assassin now.

   There are certainly times where the story veers into epic fantasy
   cliches, but it’s almost a pleasure to see how Beddor twists the
   classic tale to fit the cliches. Unfortunately, it looks like this book
   is out of print, so you might have to hunt it down. I recommend you do.
   I had a lot of fun reading it and, if you enjoy epic fantasy and
   alternative takes on Alice, you will too.

The Broken Sword

   Published the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring (and therefore
   uninfluenced by Tolkien), The Broken Sword is a novel that has all the
   matter-of-fact grimness of Norse legends (and some of the characters
   and settings, too), whilst telling an epic fantasy tale in much less
   space than Tolkien ever managed it.

   The book tells the story of the son of Orm the Strong, Scafloc.
   Unfortunately, elves steal that son and replace it with a changeling,
   Valgard (who is half-elf and half-troll). Orm unwittingly raises
   Valgard, the elves raise Scafloc. There’s wars, the eponymous broken
   sword, and betrayal. There’s also incest, murder, and the general sense
   of inevitable doom that comes from a culture whose philosophy ends with
   Ragnarok in which everyone dies (well, almost everyone).

   This is fantasy that isn’t inspired by Christian values or even
   traditional good vs evil narratives. If you’re the sort of person who
   enjoys the Norse mythology, this is a fantasy novel for you. And if
   you’re looking for something a little less spiritually uplifting than
   traditional fantasy, you should give this a go too.

Mort

   If you ask me, Mort is the perfect Discworld book. It’s early enough in
   the series that it serves as a great starting point, but it’s late
   enough that Pratchett has got a grip on his creation. It tells the
   story of Mort, a young boy who somehow ends up the apprentice of Death.
   Yes, the skeletal chap who reaps souls and TALKS LIKE THIS. It’s funny,
   it’s sweet, and it’s full of clever observations of life that make you
   think a little too much, and laugh plenty.

   But the humour isn’t what makes this a great fantasy novel. It’s
   Pratchett’s inventiveness that does that. He likes to indulge in all
   the tropes of fantasy, and play and lampoon them in clever ways. For
   instance, magical rites are performed with plenty of pomp and ceremony,
   but Pratchett reveals that this is more to do with pride and
   professional prestige; most magic can be performed with very little
   indeed. I also liked the way Pratchett incorporated the idea of
   morphogenetics, ludicrous in real life but fascinating “science” for a
   fantasy novel. And, of course, the way Ankh-Morpork reflects every
   major city is always insightful and hilarious.

   But the truth is that I like this book so much because of Death. Of
   course, Death has become such a huge character that we’re no longer
   surprised when the embodiment of death isn’t grim and murderous. But
   it’s still a pleasure to see Death so likeable, so hapless, and even
   funny. He isn’t a killer at all. He’s simply performing an existential
   duty. He’s doing the job we gave him, which he’s very good at, and
   trying to understand people, which he isn’t good at. Which brings us
   back around to the comedy again, as Death tries to understand people,
   and people try to explain things that don’t make much sense when you
   think about them too long.

   If you’ve never read a Discworld novel, this is the one to start with.
   If you’ve read Discworld, but haven’t read this one, do so. And if you
   don’t think Discworld is your cup of tea, do yourself a favour and give
   this one a try.

A Game of Thrones

   If you’re someone who loves a grounded fantasy full of detail and lore
   that also feels like it could actually happen, the first book of the
   Song of Ice and Fire series is for you. You can understand why it takes
   George R R Martin so long to write one of these, because they’re packed
   to the gills with story and world.

   But be warned: there are no happy endings in Westeros.

   One of the reasons A Game of Thrones has attracted so much attention is
   that it is a fantasy novel like no other. It is brutal, it is coarse,
   it is harsh and it has no remorse. Martin doesn’t tip-toe around the
   truth of the story. Characters have sex, get hurt, get maimed, and die.
   Love that character? They’re going to die. Hate that character? Well,
   they’ll probably die too; everybody does. In this way the novel is very
   fair: nobody gets what they want. Especially the reader.

   Speaking of endings, you might be put off reading this because the
   ending of the TV series was somewhat controversial. Put that out of
   your mind; the novels are taking their own path, and even if the
   endings are similar, Martin’s work will make much more sense. So if
   you’re tired of books with happy endings, and you’re looking for
   something gritty and grounded, you can’t go wrong with A Game of
   Thrones.

American Gods

   If you’ve ever read Neil Gaiman, you probably know what to expect. If
   you haven’t, this is a good place to start.

   The basic premise is that gods are real. All of them. And they walk
   among us. Anansi, Anubis, Bilquis, Ēostre, Odin. You might not have
   heard of them, because they’re the ancient gods of all of the various
   cultures that came to America countless generations ago. As time went
   on, people stopped believing in them, and they became less powerful.
   But still there.

   American Gods tells the tale of Shadow Moon, a man who leaves prison
   and is drawn into this world of ancient gods by the enigmatic Mr
   Wednesday. The novel is, effectively, a road trip across America,
   meeting gods both old and new, while Shadow tries to figure out what’s
   going on.

   Because new gods rose to take the old gods’ place. Gods of technology
   and television, the Internet and the stock exchange. It’s a fun
   concept, and it’s always interesting to turn a page and see which
   entity Gaiman decides we’ve decided to immortalise as a god.

   Shadow is the stereotypical clueless narrator, serving as a way for the
   other characters to explain what’s going on, but they don’t often
   bother. This means there’s a huge mystery beneath the surface, and
   while every mystery can be sometimes infuriating (why won’t someone
   just say what’s going on?), the payoff is totally worth it.

   But watch out for the middle section; it’s a bit slow, and it puts
   people off, but stick with it: it’s totally worth it.

The Darkness That Comes Before

   It only occurred to me when writing this that The Darkness That Comes
   Before reminds me of A Game of Thrones, only with less swearing and
   sex. But it has that same density to it; it’s not an easy read, but
   it’s stuffed with lore and story.

   Like A Game of Thrones, true heroes are few and far between; most of
   the characters are instead varying degrees of reprehensible. The
   Darkness That Comes Before also tells a complicated story of political
   scheming and a potentially supernatural threat. However I feel that
   Bakker’s novel is far more labyrinthine than Martin’s. The Darkness
   That Comes Before defies simple explanation; try to find a plot summary
   and you’ll reach the end more confused than when you started reading
   it.

   But don’t let that put you off. This is certainly no straightforward
   adventure fantasy, and it’s a book that requires all of your attention
   to keep it straight in your mind. But I have never read a fantasy novel
   that felt so real and even as it threatens to confuse you with its
   complexity at every step, it develops in you a kind of Stockholm
   Syndrome. Even as the novel abuses your mind, you can’t help but start
   to admire it. And soon, you’re recommending that other people read it.

Rivers of London

   I went through months of people telling me that this book reminded me
   of them before I read it and realised they’re absolutely right; Rivers
   of London reads like a book I narrated. It’s sarcastic and a little
   cynical with some dark humour mixed in. In fact, it’s hard to shake the
   feeling that this is the sort of book I should be writing…

   Rivers of London is an urban fantasy, telling the story of regular
   policeman Peter Grant who stumbles across the existence of a secret
   branch of the police that deals with the paranormal. A fairly standard
   urban fantasy plot so far. But the way Aaronovitch builds his world has
   a surprisingly Neil Gaiman-esque vibe to it; I saw surprising because
   of the humour that’s laced throughout the book. Seriously, if you ever
   needed a book called A Practical Guide to Sarcasm, this book would be a
   contender.

   But I happen to think sarcasm is funny.

   Naturally, with Grant being a policeman, there’s a mystery to solve. To
   be honest, I found myself less bothered by the mystery than perhaps I
   should have been. That’s because I was enjoying the sheer pleasure of
   the writing, the banter, and poor Grant’s cluelessness (yes, this is a
   new world to him, but it seems pretty obvious that, for example, pale
   people who don’t go outside might be more than they seem). Ordinarily,
   such cluelessness would annoy me, but Grant is so likeable that it’s
   hard to be irritated with him. Although it does make you wonder about
   his detective skills.

   Still, the hype around this series is deserved. Even if you’re not a
   big fan of sarcasm, give it a read: I think you’ll agree it belongs on
   a list of the best fantasy books.

Truckers

   Yes, Pratchett is on this list twice, but considering how many books
   the man wrote, it’s amazing that Terry Pratchett doesn’t dominate the
   entire thing! And, quite frankly, Truckers deserves a spot because it’s
   great and I love it.

   I actually first encountered Truckers via the kids TV series (which was
   a great adaptation, and you should watch it), but quickly discovered
   the book is far superior. The idea is simple; Masklin’s tribe of tiny
   nomes find their way into a (soon to be demolished) department store
   where the nomes don’t believe in the outside world.

   This leads to a great deal of humorous misunderstandings about rain and
   wind which will delight a child, and there’s plenty of Pratchett’s
   trademark wit that makes the books fun for adults too.

   Being for kids, Truckers is a quick and easy read, so it’s perfect for
   when you haven’t got much time for reading. It also means there’s no
   excuse for not reading, so get to it!

A Monster Calls

   This book is so good I had to stop reading it because I was about to
   cry on a train.

   The basic premise is that young boy Conor is watching his mother
   succumb to cancer. He’s isolated and scared and lonely. And one night,
   a gigantic monster comes to his bedroom. It promises to tell him three
   true stories, and then Conor must tell a story. If the story he tells
   is not true, the monster will destroy Conor.

   What follows is a story that moved me very deeply. A Monster Calls
   offers no easy answers, no saccharine solutions. It paints the world as
   tricky and complicated. Conor’s pain and isolation is handled
   perfectly; Ness never fumbles for your heartstrings. And the monster’s
   stories are delightfully old, filled with the dark injustices and
   terrible vengeances of ancient tales.

   It’s hard to find a criticism of this book, to be honest. I must
   strongly recommend you buy the illustrated edition, though; there are
   few pages that aren’t touched by Jim Kay’s dark and energetic work, but
   it supports the text rather than overshadowing it.

   Oh, and try not to read it in public places. Unless you’re okay with
   crying in public.

The Raven Tower

   Ann Leckie is a phenomenal writer, and I try to hold off from buying
   her books because I devour them in a matter of days, leaving me left to
   wait until the next one is released. The Raven Tower is her first
   fantasy book and, while I have to admit it wasn’t as great as her
   Imperial Radch trilogy, it’s pretty great.

   One disclaimer, though: it’s written in the second person. Like
   this:And you turned fully to stare at your hand against the wall, and
   then down at your feet, feeling that constant, faint, grinding
   vibration traveling through the yellowish stones. Could you hear me,
   Eolo? Can you hear me now? I’m talking to you.

   The Raven Tower is narrated by a god. Yep, an honest-to-god god called
   Strength and Patience of the Hill. But it’s a tale told to another
   character, Eolo. Both serve as the main characters, but interestingly
   we only ever get Strength and Patience of the Hill’s impressions of
   Eolo. The god guesses at the thoughts and motivations, rather than
   being given to the reader by the character or by an omniscient
   narrator. That makes this book interesting, but it also puts a distance
   between the reader and one of the main characters.

   This distance is the biggest flaw of the book. When I first began
   writing, nearly every writer handing out advice told me not to try to
   write in the second person. This is good advice. It’s fiendishly
   difficult to pull off. The only reason that Leckie manages it is
   because she’s a damn good writer.

   The world she’s created is fascinating. The mystery she weaves is
   enthralling. You might guess the answer to the mystery, but you
   probably won’t guess how that can be the answer until Leckie tells you.

   One other warning: this is not a book if you want sword and sorcery and
   adventure. In fact, the book ends where many other authors would launch
   into the big meaty action scenes! This is a different kind of fantasy
   novel. It’s not without action. But it’s more cerebral. If you’re
   looking for a change of pace that’s brilliantly written, you can’t go
   wrong with The Raven Tower.

The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe

   It’s a classic for a reason, and you’ll never look at Turkish Delight
   the same way again.

   What child hasn’t daydreamed about a secret doorway that takes them to
   a magical world? Even better, a magical world where they’re royalty.
   Such daydreams take on an almost unbearable pathos when Lewis makes
   them real for four kids during wartime Britain, but let’s be honest:
   we’re here for Narnia, not the Second World War. And Narnia doesn’t
   disappoint.

   Lewis was a contemporary of Tolkien, and it shows: you won’t get gritty
   or grounded fantasy, but something far more allegorical. In fact, the
   Aslan/Jesus parallels are almost a little too on the nose at times, but
   you’ll let Lewis off the hook because Aslan is great. And if he’s a
   little too perfect, the White Witch is a little too frightening really.

   Seriously, I’ve never been able to give Turkish Delight a fair shake
   because of this book. But then, Turkish Delight is gross. Quite why
   it’s such a temptation to these kids is beyond me…

The Armoured Saint

   The title and the cover art for this one had me hooked straightaway.
   Perhaps it’s because it reminded me of the Sisters of Battle, a
   power-armoured ecclesiastic army in Warhammer 40,000, a game I used to
   play as a teenager. So I was looking forward to seeing this armoured
   saint in action.

   But, when it comes to action, The Armoured Saint is slow to get moving.
   There’s action, sure, but this novel really feels like it’s setting up
   the rest of the series. It could serve as a prequel, even. And the
   foreshadowing is a little too obvious. As soon as the suit of armour
   appears on the page, you know what’s going to happen. Except it doesn’t
   happen for a long time. This, to be honest, was frustrating.

   So why is it on this list? Because when the action finally does kick
   off, it’s worth the wait. There might have been too much build-up, but
   I still finished this novel with a sense of satisfaction and a desire
   to read the next in the series.

   (Hot tip: I actually listened to the audiobook version, but the
   narration is dreadfully slow: this is definitely one to listen to at
   1.25x speed!)

Talion: Revenant

   Michael A Stackpole writes a fantastic line in late-80s fantasy
   fiction. It might seem quaint by comparison with the grittier fare that
   is modern fantasy, but it’s hard not to enjoy the way Stackpole romps
   through the story of Nolan, a young man training to be a Justice.

   Let’s be clear that this novel is not a weighty tome; it’s a fun,
   straightforward affair, and enjoyable for it. The story is split
   between the trials of Nolan’s training and the present day, in which he
   is tasked with protecting the man who killed his family. Both of these
   throw challenges into Nolan’s path, but they’re nearly always dealt
   with quickly. Even the huge conflict of protecting a man he blames for
   slaughtering his family is quite easily handled. But that’s not really
   a huge criticism.

   That’s because Stackpole writes an uncomplicated novel; challenges and
   trials are action set pieces, overcome so the action can continue. And
   there’s plenty of action. Goblins and sorcerers, wood elves and the
   undead. This is a galloping blockbuster of a novel, and if it doesn’t
   require a lot of thought, it’s a lot of fun to read. Is that enough to
   warrant a place on a list of the best fantasy books? I think so. Not
   every fantasy book has to be a sprawling epic, a mighty trilogy, or an
   overwrought drama. Sometimes it’s just a fun piece of escapism, and
   Talion: Revenant is certainly that.

   And a fun read seems like a good place to end this list. But I’ll be
   updating it as I discover new and interesting reads! If you come across
   a book you think deserves to be on this list, let me know!

The Fey Man

   Don’t think I’m being egotistical and trying to include my own novel in
   a list of the best fantasy books! But it would be madness not to at
   least mention The Fey Man. Obviously I’m biased, but I think you’ll
   like it!

   It’s the first book in the Realm Rift Saga, and it tells the tale of
   Thomas Rymour, the prophet who cannot lie. An elf lord hatches a plot
   to save the world by stealing a legendary sword; a sword that, it turns
   out, only Tom can wield. Tom is forced to break his oath in order to
   save the world. But while terrifying dragons scorch the skies, the
   immortal creatures of Faerie hatch their own dark plans for the mortal
   realm.

   And these creatures aren’t delightful little fairies. Oh no. They’re
   fearsome monsters that take pleasure in anything that alleviates the
   boredom of eternity. That ranges from wordplay and innocent pranks all
   the way up to torture and murder. Whatever takes their fancy.

   From the frozen heights of the world to its labyrinthine depths, Tom
   will face immortal creatures, terrifying dragons, and undead monsters
   on his impossible quest to save the people he loves and the world they
   live in. But how can he defeat an enemy that cannot be killed?

   And that seems like a good place to end this list. But I’ll be updating
   it as I discover new and interesting reads! If you come across a book
   you think deserves to be on this list, let me know!

25 of the Best Fantasy Books You Should Read Next

   [25bestfantasybooks.jpg]

   I know what it’s like: sometimes you finish a book and you just don’t
   know what to read next. That’s why I’ve put this list together of 25 of
   the best fantasy books (in no particular order) that should be at the
   top of your to-read list!

   And if you’re in the mood for science fiction instead, I’ve got a list
   for you too.

Assassin’s Apprentice

   Any list of the best fantasy books has to start with Assassin’s
   Apprentice! The beginning of the Farseer trilogy, and also the
   beginning of a nine book series that tells the life of Fitz, bastard
   son of a disgraced prince, and his remarkable, hidden role in history.

   Hobb’s Fitz books are very much a coming of age story, so if you’re a
   fan of tight action and lean prose, pass on this one. But if you like a
   fantasy book that enjoys its time with the world and it’s characters,
   take a look at Assassin’s Apprentice.

   Fitz is a great viewpoint character, flawed but full of good
   intentions, and he’s supported by a huge range of varied characters
   that are easy to love, and opposed by villains that are easy to hate.

   Although this is the beginning of a story that will take nine books to
   tell, don’t worry about getting sucked into a nine book series; the
   first trilogy stands alone. In fact, I think it’s the best of the
   three, although the second trilogy is very good too!

A Sorcerer Slain

   If you liked the sound of a murder mystery in a fantasy novel, but
   didn’t really want a fantasy-Sherlock Holmes, then A Sorcerer Slain is
   for you. It’s funny, action-packed, and clever. And perhaps the
   greatest praise I can heap upon this book is that the lead character
   and investigator, Lowmar Dashiel, thinks like a real person.

   The story is set in the city of Andruan, where the Sorcerer Supreme has
   been murdered (he would be the sorcerer slain). This act threatens to
   topple the king and spark a civil war. With so many interested parties,
   no-one can be above suspicion. But I’ve seen too many crime stories
   where someone always is; there’s always someone the hero never suspects
   for a moment, and it’s always them that did it. Always. But Dashiel
   suspects nearly everyone at one point or another and I wanted to
   applaud every time.

   This smart writing extends to the genre blending that takes place in
   this novel. When I first heard that Sivers was writing fantasy crime,
   my first thought was that those genres were unusual bedfellows. But A
   Sorcerer Slain is proof they make an excellent match; it calls no
   attention to itself, borrowing tropes from both fantasy and crime as it
   wills. At no point do these genres clash, and most of the time they’re
   perfectly balanced.

   In fact, the only thing that lets down this novel is when those genres
   become unbalanced, and it embraces the fantasy genre too strongly. For
   instance, there’s a great battle which on paper sounds great for a
   fantasy novel. But this book is smaller, more intimate, and the battle
   felt out of place to me. Once things had got back to Dashiel’s smaller
   world, things felt more natural.

   So if epic fantasy is the only kind of fantasy you’ll entertain, give
   this one a pass. But if you’re in the mood for something a little
   different, this crime fantasy might just scratch that itch.

Children of Blood and Bone

   If you’re tired of medieval-European fantasy, this is an excellent
   choice for your next read. Adeyemi has written a story of persecution,
   magic, and raw emotion that will catch you by surprise at times. This
   might be a YA novel, but it doesn’t pull any punches; alongside the
   smiles and the romance, there’s a lot of death, violence, and heartache
   too.

   Children of Blood and Bone tells the tale of Zélie Adebola, whose
   mother was killed when tyrannical King Saran ordered the deaths of all
   magic-wielding magi. Saran also severed the magi’s connection with the
   gods, and now magic is no more. After a chance encounter, Zélie leads a
   quest to bring magic back with the help of her brother, Tzain, and
   Saran’s daughter, Princess Amari. Standing in their way is Amari’s
   older brother, Prince Inan, but whether he is friend or foe is
   uncertain, and there is a strange connection between Inan and Zélie
   that might be more than it seems.

   Adeyemi’s novel moves at a pace, hammering through the story There’s a
   great sense of world, too. The Kingdom of Orisha feels huge, but
   there’s also a sense that there’s a big wide world beyond its borders.
   All of the characters have depth, too, and are full of the conflicts
   and uncertainties that make a character human. So much of the story
   hinges on these conflicting desires that I honestly wasn’t sure which
   way the story was going to go, which is always a good thing!

   Filled with character-driven, action-filled fantasy that differs from
   the usual medieval-European fare, and unexpectedly moving at
   times, Children of Blood and Bone really is one of the best fantasy
   books out there.

   Or, give it a listen: I got a copy of the audiobook for Children of
   Blood and Bone, and I can’t recommend enough experiencing the book this
   way. It’s beautifully narrated by Bahni Turpi, whose work is reason
   enough to pick up the audiobook instead!

The Lies of Locke Lamora

   I always think of The Lies of Locke Lamora as Ocean’s 11 meets epic
   fantasy. It’s not a perfect analogy; for instance, Scott Lynch’s novel
   doesn’t feature Don Cheadle gamely trying to squeeze as much Cockney
   rhyming slang into his dialogue as he can. But if you love a good heist
   but you like fantasy worlds too, this is the book for you.

   Locke Lamora is a member of the Gentlemen Bastards, a gang of thieves
   working under the leadership of Father Chains. They all find themselves
   wrapped up in the mysterious machinations of the Gray King, and the
   story is filled with twists, double crosses, and desperate races to
   save the day, not all of which are entirely successful.

   Locke is a witty, smooth-talking character, so don’t come to this novel
   for a gritty time. Yes, there’s violence, but there’s also jokes and
   hijinks too. The body count gets pretty high, and there’s even a bit of
   torture thrown in for good measure. But the general tone is less Game
   of Thrones and more, well, Ocean’s Eleven. It’s a good time, and a
   classic for a reason.

Ship of Magic

   Fresh off the back of the Farseer trilogy, Hobb wrote a new trilogy set
   in the same world, but with a very different setting.

   Where the Farseer trilogy dealt with magic and dragons, this new
   trilogy deals Liveships, ships made from wood imbued with magic that
   makes the ship come alive. These ships absorb the personalities of the
   people who have died on deck, which is a fascinating and slightly
   disturbing idea!

   If you read Assassin’s Apprentice and you weren’t a fan of the main
   character, Fitz, then give Ship of Magic a chance. It’s full of very
   different characters: a woman trying to become captain of a ship; a boy
   taken from his life training to be a priest; a pirate who would be
   king. Because it’s a book about ships; of course there are pirates!

   Hobb’s writing is as strong as ever, and there are some interesting,
   subtle links to her Fitz books for the eagle-eyed, but this trilogy
   stands apart from her other work.

Redwall

   Brian Jacques’ Redwall is the first in an epic fantasy series for
   children starring English woodland animals. It’s quaint and it’s sweet
   and it’s fun. It’s a fantastic introduction to fantasy for children or,
   if you’re an adult, it’s a great read between thick fantasy tomes.

   The eponymous Redwall is an abbey, populated by mice, which faces the
   threat of Cluny the Scourge, the appropriately named rat leader of an
   army curiously hell-bent on conquering the abbey. The hero, Mathias, is
   a young mouse who is always being told by his elders to be calm and
   mindful, but lusts for adventure and excitement. Naturally, it falls to
   him to somehow find a way to defend Redwall against the oncoming
   threat.

   There’s legendary warriors, an ancient sword, and riddles that will
   puzzle and please young minds (although quite how the logic works will
   puzzle older ones). Redwall should definitely be on your reading list,
   and is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy books around!

The Hobbit

   The Lord of the Rings gets all the hype and the glory, but I think The
   Hobbit is not just under-appreciated, but even (dare I say it) more
   deserving of a place on a list of the best fantasy books than it’s
   younger, bigger brother.

   Tolkien’s first major work benefits from being a sleeker, more focused
   thing. It’s not a big, sprawling epic, but an adventure story. A
   treasure hunt, in fact, with a dragon to vanquish and humorous events
   and coincidences along the way. The narrator has a knowing tone,
   sharing asides and commentary with the reader that are intended to
   delight and surprise. I’ve always had a soft spot for the invention of
   golf in Middle-Earth; this is accredited to a Took’s fortuitous
   decapitation of a goblin.

   The origin of golf sums up The Hobbit rather nicely, in fact. This is a
   fantasy adventure that isn’t meant to be taken too seriously. That
   doesn’t mean that the stakes aren’t high, or that there aren’t
   thrilling scenes and perilous moments. But this is fantasy without the
   grit and grime, so it’s perfect for when you need a spot of levity and
   adventure in your reading list.

Grendel

   This is a bit of a different one. If you like your fantasy full of
   adventure, give this one a miss. But if you’re in the mood for
   something contemplative, take a look at John C Gardner’s exploration of
   the monster Grendel.

   That’s somewhat misleading, in a sense, because there are times when
   this book feels less like an exploration of a character, and more that
   the character is simply a vehicle for an exploration of philosophy. In
   fact, there were times when reading Grendel that I wondered if Gardner
   was simply using the tropes of fantasy to write a philosophical
   treatise. Which feels unfair, because even in those moments I found
   myself enjoying the story.

   But that, in a sense, is why I always recommend Grendel, because it’s
   by no definition a standard fantasy novel. I won’t lie to you: once
   you’ve read it, you might not want to read something like it again. But
   fantasy is such a huge, wide genre that can encompass so many different
   stories. Grendel is a contemplative fantasy, and it’s a masterclass in
   taking what was a fairly nondescript monster (from Beowulf, if you
   weren’t sure), and turning it into something you can not only empathise
   with, but end up rooting for.

The Prince of Thorns

   You might have heard this before: dispossessed prince seeks to reclaim
   his throne. But it was something of as surprise to find that this
   prince was a bit of a monster.

   Lawrence certainly isn’t the first person to write an anti-hero, but I
   was surprised at how much I liked Jorg, even as he did some pretty
   unpleasant things. As is often the way, the anti-hero is saved by
   offering scathing yet honest opinions that no-one else will voice, as
   well as a minor and earnest romantic subplot. Sometimes, Jorg even
   commits decent acts, although almost by accident.

   I was also somewhat surprised to discover that this wasn’t a medieval
   fantasy, but instead a fantasy set in a far-off, post-apocalyptic
   world. Lawrence does a very good job of weaving in hints of this world
   without being heavy-handed, which I appreciated; all too often, such a
   setting is handled with the subtlety of a brick to the face.

   The only downside to The Prince of Thorns is that the ending is almost
   too neat for the first in a trilogy; the force driving you to read the
   next book isn’t really the plot, more just your enjoyment of reading
   this one. That’s hardly a terrible sin, but what can I say? I’m a
   sucker for a cliffhanger.

Spiderlight

   My relationship with Dungeons & Dragons was brief. In fact, I played a
   Dragon Quest once, and Warhammer Quest once. That’s it. But it was
   enough to familiarise me with the tropes, and so I took great joy in
   watching Adrian Tchaikovsky turn those tropes into a fun, engaging,
   thoughtful novel.

   The setup for Spiderlight is simple enough: the good guys are stalwart
   warriors of hope and faith, the bad guys are ugly and monstrous.
   Tchaikovsky turns that on its head pretty much straightaway. In fact,
   the idea that good guys aren’t always good and bad guys aren’t always
   bad runs through the entire novel.

   Unfortunately, that means that twists and surprises aren’t overly
   surprising. What was surprising was that I didn’t mind so much.
   Considering that much of Spiderlight feels like it’s based on D&D
   tropes, I was actually beginning to enjoy reading about the characters.
   This is a stand-alone novel, so there isn’t much room for the stakes to
   get to the usual dramatic heights of epic fantasy, but they felt high
   enough for an enjoyable read.

   And, while Spiderlight might not revolutionise the fantasy genre, I was
   too busy empathising with a creepy, giant spider to really notice.

Warbreaker

   To say that Brandon Sanderson is prolific is an understatement. While
   that’s great for his fans, sometimes a huge body of work can be
   somewhat intimidating. Where do you begin? Once you start, are you
   committing yourself to read dozens of books to get the full picture?
   What if you just want a taster to see if you like the author’s work
   before you dive in? Warbreaker is the taster you’ve been looking for.

   The novel is fairly standard fantasy fare, with kingdoms in peril and
   such. I did, however, appreciate that the magic system creates what are
   essentially walking gods. One of them was even my favourite character;
   Lightsong is somewhat jaded and disconnected from his life of luxury,
   so he’s in the best position to make jokes and wry observations.
   Unfortunately, Lightsong’s story takes a while to get going, which
   creates an odd dissonance between his laconic existence and the more
   traditional fantasty antics of the other characters.

   But with a magic sword, a king to overthrow, and a few surprising
   twists and turns, this is definitely worth a read.

The Looking Glass Wars

   What is it about Alice in Wonderland that has led so many writers to
   reinterpret its story and themes? Whatever it is, Frank Beddor
   certainly has a fresh take on things.

   Take Alice in Wonderland and put it in the epic fantasy blender.
   There’s a lost princess whose throne has been usurped, a kingdom under
   a tyrant’s rule, and an assassin; yes, the Mad Hatter has become the
   Hatter Madigan, and he’s a badass assassin now.

   There are certainly times where the story veers into epic fantasy
   cliches, but it’s almost a pleasure to see how Beddor twists the
   classic tale to fit the cliches. Unfortunately, it looks like this book
   is out of print, so you might have to hunt it down. I recommend you do.
   I had a lot of fun reading it and, if you enjoy epic fantasy and
   alternative takes on Alice, you will too.

The Broken Sword

   Published the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring (and therefore
   uninfluenced by Tolkien), The Broken Sword is a novel that has all the
   matter-of-fact grimness of Norse legends (and some of the characters
   and settings, too), whilst telling an epic fantasy tale in much less
   space than Tolkien ever managed it.

   The book tells the story of the son of Orm the Strong, Scafloc.
   Unfortunately, elves steal that son and replace it with a changeling,
   Valgard (who is half-elf and half-troll). Orm unwittingly raises
   Valgard, the elves raise Scafloc. There’s wars, the eponymous broken
   sword, and betrayal. There’s also incest, murder, and the general sense
   of inevitable doom that comes from a culture whose philosophy ends with
   Ragnarok in which everyone dies (well, almost everyone).

   This is fantasy that isn’t inspired by Christian values or even
   traditional good vs evil narratives. If you’re the sort of person who
   enjoys the Norse mythology, this is a fantasy novel for you. And if
   you’re looking for something a little less spiritually uplifting than
   traditional fantasy, you should give this a go too.

Mort

   If you ask me, Mort is the perfect Discworld book. It’s early enough in
   the series that it serves as a great starting point, but it’s late
   enough that Pratchett has got a grip on his creation. It tells the
   story of Mort, a young boy who somehow ends up the apprentice of Death.
   Yes, the skeletal chap who reaps souls and TALKS LIKE THIS. It’s funny,
   it’s sweet, and it’s full of clever observations of life that make you
   think a little too much, and laugh plenty.

   But the humour isn’t what makes this a great fantasy novel. It’s
   Pratchett’s inventiveness that does that. He likes to indulge in all
   the tropes of fantasy, and play and lampoon them in clever ways. For
   instance, magical rites are performed with plenty of pomp and ceremony,
   but Pratchett reveals that this is more to do with pride and
   professional prestige; most magic can be performed with very little
   indeed. I also liked the way Pratchett incorporated the idea of
   morphogenetics, ludicrous in real life but fascinating “science” for a
   fantasy novel. And, of course, the way Ankh-Morpork reflects every
   major city is always insightful and hilarious.

   But the truth is that I like this book so much because of Death. Of
   course, Death has become such a huge character that we’re no longer
   surprised when the embodiment of death isn’t grim and murderous. But
   it’s still a pleasure to see Death so likeable, so hapless, and even
   funny. He isn’t a killer at all. He’s simply performing an existential
   duty. He’s doing the job we gave him, which he’s very good at, and
   trying to understand people, which he isn’t good at. Which brings us
   back around to the comedy again, as Death tries to understand people,
   and people try to explain things that don’t make much sense when you
   think about them too long.

   If you’ve never read a Discworld novel, this is the one to start with.
   If you’ve read Discworld, but haven’t read this one, do so. And if you
   don’t think Discworld is your cup of tea, do yourself a favour and give
   this one a try.

A Game of Thrones

   If you’re someone who loves a grounded fantasy full of detail and lore
   that also feels like it could actually happen, the first book of the
   Song of Ice and Fire series is for you. You can understand why it takes
   George R R Martin so long to write one of these, because they’re packed
   to the gills with story and world.

   But be warned: there are no happy endings in Westeros.

   One of the reasons A Game of Thrones has attracted so much attention is
   that it is a fantasy novel like no other. It is brutal, it is coarse,
   it is harsh and it has no remorse. Martin doesn’t tip-toe around the
   truth of the story. Characters have sex, get hurt, get maimed, and die.
   Love that character? They’re going to die. Hate that character? Well,
   they’ll probably die too; everybody does. In this way the novel is very
   fair: nobody gets what they want. Especially the reader.

   Speaking of endings, you might be put off reading this because the
   ending of the TV series was somewhat controversial. Put that out of
   your mind; the novels are taking their own path, and even if the
   endings are similar, Martin’s work will make much more sense. So if
   you’re tired of books with happy endings, and you’re looking for
   something gritty and grounded, you can’t go wrong with A Game of
   Thrones.

American Gods

   If you’ve ever read Neil Gaiman, you probably know what to expect. If
   you haven’t, this is a good place to start.

   The basic premise is that gods are real. All of them. And they walk
   among us. Anansi, Anubis, Bilquis, Ēostre, Odin. You might not have
   heard of them, because they’re the ancient gods of all of the various
   cultures that came to America countless generations ago. As time went
   on, people stopped believing in them, and they became less powerful.
   But still there.

   American Gods tells the tale of Shadow Moon, a man who leaves prison
   and is drawn into this world of ancient gods by the enigmatic Mr
   Wednesday. The novel is, effectively, a road trip across America,
   meeting gods both old and new, while Shadow tries to figure out what’s
   going on.

   Because new gods rose to take the old gods’ place. Gods of technology
   and television, the Internet and the stock exchange. It’s a fun
   concept, and it’s always interesting to turn a page and see which
   entity Gaiman decides we’ve decided to immortalise as a god.

   Shadow is the stereotypical clueless narrator, serving as a way for the
   other characters to explain what’s going on, but they don’t often
   bother. This means there’s a huge mystery beneath the surface, and
   while every mystery can be sometimes infuriating (why won’t someone
   just say what’s going on?), the payoff is totally worth it.

   But watch out for the middle section; it’s a bit slow, and it puts
   people off, but stick with it: it’s totally worth it.

The Darkness That Comes Before

   It only occurred to me when writing this that The Darkness That Comes
   Before reminds me of A Game of Thrones, only with less swearing and
   sex. But it has that same density to it; it’s not an easy read, but
   it’s stuffed with lore and story.

   Like A Game of Thrones, true heroes are few and far between; most of
   the characters are instead varying degrees of reprehensible. The
   Darkness That Comes Before also tells a complicated story of political
   scheming and a potentially supernatural threat. However I feel that
   Bakker’s novel is far more labyrinthine than Martin’s. The Darkness
   That Comes Before defies simple explanation; try to find a plot summary
   and you’ll reach the end more confused than when you started reading
   it.

   But don’t let that put you off. This is certainly no straightforward
   adventure fantasy, and it’s a book that requires all of your attention
   to keep it straight in your mind. But I have never read a fantasy novel
   that felt so real and even as it threatens to confuse you with its
   complexity at every step, it develops in you a kind of Stockholm
   Syndrome. Even as the novel abuses your mind, you can’t help but start
   to admire it. And soon, you’re recommending that other people read it.

Rivers of London

   I went through months of people telling me that this book reminded me
   of them before I read it and realised they’re absolutely right; Rivers
   of London reads like a book I narrated. It’s sarcastic and a little
   cynical with some dark humour mixed in. In fact, it’s hard to shake the
   feeling that this is the sort of book I should be writing…

   Rivers of London is an urban fantasy, telling the story of regular
   policeman Peter Grant who stumbles across the existence of a secret
   branch of the police that deals with the paranormal. A fairly standard
   urban fantasy plot so far. But the way Aaronovitch builds his world has
   a surprisingly Neil Gaiman-esque vibe to it; I saw surprising because
   of the humour that’s laced throughout the book. Seriously, if you ever
   needed a book called A Practical Guide to Sarcasm, this book would be a
   contender.

   But I happen to think sarcasm is funny.

   Naturally, with Grant being a policeman, there’s a mystery to solve. To
   be honest, I found myself less bothered by the mystery than perhaps I
   should have been. That’s because I was enjoying the sheer pleasure of
   the writing, the banter, and poor Grant’s cluelessness (yes, this is a
   new world to him, but it seems pretty obvious that, for example, pale
   people who don’t go outside might be more than they seem). Ordinarily,
   such cluelessness would annoy me, but Grant is so likeable that it’s
   hard to be irritated with him. Although it does make you wonder about
   his detective skills.

   Still, the hype around this series is deserved. Even if you’re not a
   big fan of sarcasm, give it a read: I think you’ll agree it belongs on
   a list of the best fantasy books.

Truckers

   Yes, Pratchett is on this list twice, but considering how many books
   the man wrote, it’s amazing that Terry Pratchett doesn’t dominate the
   entire thing! And, quite frankly, Truckers deserves a spot because it’s
   great and I love it.

   I actually first encountered Truckers via the kids TV series (which was
   a great adaptation, and you should watch it), but quickly discovered
   the book is far superior. The idea is simple; Masklin’s tribe of tiny
   nomes find their way into a (soon to be demolished) department store
   where the nomes don’t believe in the outside world.

   This leads to a great deal of humorous misunderstandings about rain and
   wind which will delight a child, and there’s plenty of Pratchett’s
   trademark wit that makes the books fun for adults too.

   Being for kids, Truckers is a quick and easy read, so it’s perfect for
   when you haven’t got much time for reading. It also means there’s no
   excuse for not reading, so get to it!

A Monster Calls

   This book is so good I had to stop reading it because I was about to
   cry on a train.

   The basic premise is that young boy Conor is watching his mother
   succumb to cancer. He’s isolated and scared and lonely. And one night,
   a gigantic monster comes to his bedroom. It promises to tell him three
   true stories, and then Conor must tell a story. If the story he tells
   is not true, the monster will destroy Conor.

   What follows is a story that moved me very deeply. A Monster Calls
   offers no easy answers, no saccharine solutions. It paints the world as
   tricky and complicated. Conor’s pain and isolation is handled
   perfectly; Ness never fumbles for your heartstrings. And the monster’s
   stories are delightfully old, filled with the dark injustices and
   terrible vengeances of ancient tales.

   It’s hard to find a criticism of this book, to be honest. I must
   strongly recommend you buy the illustrated edition, though; there are
   few pages that aren’t touched by Jim Kay’s dark and energetic work, but
   it supports the text rather than overshadowing it.

   Oh, and try not to read it in public places. Unless you’re okay with
   crying in public.

The Raven Tower

   Ann Leckie is a phenomenal writer, and I try to hold off from buying
   her books because I devour them in a matter of days, leaving me left to
   wait until the next one is released. The Raven Tower is her first
   fantasy book and, while I have to admit it wasn’t as great as her
   Imperial Radch trilogy, it’s pretty great.

   One disclaimer, though: it’s written in the second person. Like
   this:And you turned fully to stare at your hand against the wall, and
   then down at your feet, feeling that constant, faint, grinding
   vibration traveling through the yellowish stones. Could you hear me,
   Eolo? Can you hear me now? I’m talking to you.

   The Raven Tower is narrated by a god. Yep, an honest-to-god god called
   Strength and Patience of the Hill. But it’s a tale told to another
   character, Eolo. Both serve as the main characters, but interestingly
   we only ever get Strength and Patience of the Hill’s impressions of
   Eolo. The god guesses at the thoughts and motivations, rather than
   being given to the reader by the character or by an omniscient
   narrator. That makes this book interesting, but it also puts a distance
   between the reader and one of the main characters.

   This distance is the biggest flaw of the book. When I first began
   writing, nearly every writer handing out advice told me not to try to
   write in the second person. This is good advice. It’s fiendishly
   difficult to pull off. The only reason that Leckie manages it is
   because she’s a damn good writer.

   The world she’s created is fascinating. The mystery she weaves is
   enthralling. You might guess the answer to the mystery, but you
   probably won’t guess how that can be the answer until Leckie tells you.

   One other warning: this is not a book if you want sword and sorcery and
   adventure. In fact, the book ends where many other authors would launch
   into the big meaty action scenes! This is a different kind of fantasy
   novel. It’s not without action. But it’s more cerebral. If you’re
   looking for a change of pace that’s brilliantly written, you can’t go
   wrong with The Raven Tower.

The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe

   It’s a classic for a reason, and you’ll never look at Turkish Delight
   the same way again.

   What child hasn’t daydreamed about a secret doorway that takes them to
   a magical world? Even better, a magical world where they’re royalty.
   Such daydreams take on an almost unbearable pathos when Lewis makes
   them real for four kids during wartime Britain, but let’s be honest:
   we’re here for Narnia, not the Second World War. And Narnia doesn’t
   disappoint.

   Lewis was a contemporary of Tolkien, and it shows: you won’t get gritty
   or grounded fantasy, but something far more allegorical. In fact, the
   Aslan/Jesus parallels are almost a little too on the nose at times, but
   you’ll let Lewis off the hook because Aslan is great. And if he’s a
   little too perfect, the White Witch is a little too frightening really.

   Seriously, I’ve never been able to give Turkish Delight a fair shake
   because of this book. But then, Turkish Delight is gross. Quite why
   it’s such a temptation to these kids is beyond me…

The Armoured Saint

   The title and the cover art for this one had me hooked straightaway.
   Perhaps it’s because it reminded me of the Sisters of Battle, a
   power-armoured ecclesiastic army in Warhammer 40,000, a game I used to
   play as a teenager. So I was looking forward to seeing this armoured
   saint in action.

   But, when it comes to action, The Armoured Saint is slow to get moving.
   There’s action, sure, but this novel really feels like it’s setting up
   the rest of the series. It could serve as a prequel, even. And the
   foreshadowing is a little too obvious. As soon as the suit of armour
   appears on the page, you know what’s going to happen. Except it doesn’t
   happen for a long time. This, to be honest, was frustrating.

   So why is it on this list? Because when the action finally does kick
   off, it’s worth the wait. There might have been too much build-up, but
   I still finished this novel with a sense of satisfaction and a desire
   to read the next in the series.

   (Hot tip: I actually listened to the audiobook version, but the
   narration is dreadfully slow: this is definitely one to listen to at
   1.25x speed!)

Talion: Revenant

   Michael A Stackpole writes a fantastic line in late-80s fantasy
   fiction. It might seem quaint by comparison with the grittier fare that
   is modern fantasy, but it’s hard not to enjoy the way Stackpole romps
   through the story of Nolan, a young man training to be a Justice.

   Let’s be clear that this novel is not a weighty tome; it’s a fun,
   straightforward affair, and enjoyable for it. The story is split
   between the trials of Nolan’s training and the present day, in which he
   is tasked with protecting the man who killed his family. Both of these
   throw challenges into Nolan’s path, but they’re nearly always dealt
   with quickly. Even the huge conflict of protecting a man he blames for
   slaughtering his family is quite easily handled. But that’s not really
   a huge criticism.

   That’s because Stackpole writes an uncomplicated novel; challenges and
   trials are action set pieces, overcome so the action can continue. And
   there’s plenty of action. Goblins and sorcerers, wood elves and the
   undead. This is a galloping blockbuster of a novel, and if it doesn’t
   require a lot of thought, it’s a lot of fun to read. Is that enough to
   warrant a place on a list of the best fantasy books? I think so. Not
   every fantasy book has to be a sprawling epic, a mighty trilogy, or an
   overwrought drama. Sometimes it’s just a fun piece of escapism, and
   Talion: Revenant is certainly that.

   And a fun read seems like a good place to end this list. But I’ll be
   updating it as I discover new and interesting reads! If you come across
   a book you think deserves to be on this list, let me know!

The Fey Man

   Don’t think I’m being egotistical and trying to include my own novel in
   a list of the best fantasy books! But it would be madness not to at
   least mention The Fey Man. Obviously I’m biased, but I think you’ll
   like it!

   It’s the first book in the Realm Rift Saga, and it tells the tale of
   Thomas Rymour, the prophet who cannot lie. An elf lord hatches a plot
   to save the world by stealing a legendary sword; a sword that, it turns
   out, only Tom can wield. Tom is forced to break his oath in order to
   save the world. But while terrifying dragons scorch the skies, the
   immortal creatures of Faerie hatch their own dark plans for the mortal
   realm.

   And these creatures aren’t delightful little fairies. Oh no. They’re
   fearsome monsters that take pleasure in anything that alleviates the
   boredom of eternity. That ranges from wordplay and innocent pranks all
   the way up to torture and murder. Whatever takes their fancy.

   From the frozen heights of the world to its labyrinthine depths, Tom
   will face immortal creatures, terrifying dragons, and undead monsters
   on his impossible quest to save the people he loves and the world they
   live in. But how can he defeat an enemy that cannot be killed?

   And that seems like a good place to end this list. But I’ll be updating
   it as I discover new and interesting reads! If you come across a book
   you think deserves to be on this list, let me know!
