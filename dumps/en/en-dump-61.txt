       Xavier Worthy KC WR

Chiefs' Xavier Worthy: Doubtful for season finale
       6m ago
       Worthy (illness) is officially listed as doubtful for Sunday's
       season finale against the Raiders.
       Worthy could not practice in any capacity during Week 18 prep due
       to an illness, and it appears as though he'll sit out Kansas City's
       season finale. With Tyquan Thornton (concussion) and Rashee Rice
       (concussion) both on IR, Hollywood Brown, JuJu Smith-Schuster and
       Jalen Royals will be positioned as Kansas City's starters in
       three-receiver stets to close out the 2025 campaign, assuming
       Worthy is indeed ruled out prior to Sunday's 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff.

       Malik Davis DAL RB

Cowboys' Malik Davis: Out for Week 18
       6m ago
       Davis (eye/calf) and Javonte Williams (neck/shoulder) have been
       ruled out for Sunday's game at the Giants, Jon Machota of The
       Athletic reports.
       Davis reportedly still can't see well after taking a blow to the
       eye during last week's win over Washington. He finished the game
       with 20 carries for 103 yards, both career highs, arguably making
       him the favorite for the No. 2 RB role in Dallas next year.
       Williams is scheduled for free agency, but the Cowboys likely will
       re-sign him or pursue a replacement. The 27-year-old Davis has some
       parallels to Rico Dowdle, who also lingered around the Dallas
       roster and practice squad for years before getting his shot as the
       No. 2 RB, which he later parlayed into a starting job.

       Samori Toure NO WR

Saints' Samori Toure: Promoted Friday
       7m ago
       Toure signed with the Saints' active roster Friday, Mike Triplett
       of NewOrleans.Football reports.
       The 27-year-old's last in-game action came with the Packers in
       2023, when he appeared in 11 contests and caught eight of 18
       targets for 78 yards. Now in New Orleans, Toure is expected to
       operate as one of the Saints' top wideouts in the Week 18 matchup
       against the Falcons, playing alongside Kevin Austin, Dante Pettis
       and Ronnie Bell.

       Isiah Pacheco KC RB

Chiefs' Isiah Pacheco: Questionable for Week 18
       8m ago
       Pacheco (rest) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game in Las
       Vegas.
       Pachecho was listed as limited on all three of the Chiefs' Week 18
       injury reports with rest, while fellow RB Kareem Hunt didn't
       practice Wednesday or Thursday due to an illness before returning
       to a full session Friday. Having said that, Pacheco is entering the
       weekend with a designation, and Hunt is not. Kansas City is out of
       playoff contention, so the team may opt to rest Pacheco, but such a
       decision doesn't need to be made until about 90 minutes before
       Sunday's 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff. If Pacheco is inhibited or sidelined
       this weekend, Hunt, Brashard Smith and Dameon Pierce would be lined
       up to handle the backfield.

       Kevin Austin Jr. NO WR

Saints' Kevin Austin: Stepping into key role Week 18
       9m ago
       Austin is positioned as one of New Orleans' top starting wideouts
       for Sunday's season finale against the Falcons due to Chris Olave
       (illness) being ruled out for Week 18.
       Austin has already played more than 80 percent of offensive snaps
       in back-to-back games, in which span he's secured six of eight
       targets for 70 yards and one score. He saw those expanded
       opportunities due to the absence of Mason Tipton (groin), who has
       since been placed on IR. With Olave now also out for Week 18 due a
       blood clot in his lung, Austin appears positioned as the No. 1
       wideout for a receiving corps that also includes Dante Pettis and
       practice-squad players Ronnie Bell and Samori Toure. Austin will
       work to make the most of his elevated opportunity versus Atlanta
       and continue demonstrating chemistry with rookie quarterback Tyler
       Shough.

       Ronnie Bell NO WR

Saints' Ronnie Bell: Joins active roster
       11m ago
       Bell signed with the Saints' active roster Friday, Mike Triplett of
       NewOrleans.Football reports.
       The third-year pro from Michigan will join the Saints' active
       roster for the second consecutive week after failing to record an
       offensive statistic across nine total snaps (seven on special
       teams, two on offense) in the Week 17 win over the Titans. Bell is
       expected to operate as one of New Orleans' top wideouts in Sunday's
       matchup against the Falcons, as Chris Olave (blood clots), Mason
       Tipton (groin), Trey Palmer (ankle), Devaughn Vele (shoulder), Bub
       Means (lower leg) and Ja'Lynn Polk (shoulder) will all be
       sidelined.

       Ryan Fitzgerald MIN 3B

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster
       35m ago
       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

       Eric Wagaman MIA 1B

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       1h ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. The right-handed-hitting Wagaman sported a
       .283/.321/.462 batting line against lefties in 2025, so much of his
       playing time in Minnesota could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Ticketed to play defense in 2026
       7h ago
       Fry (face) is expected to resume playing on the field in 2026, Tim
       Stebbins of MLB.com reports. An elbow injury limited Fry to
       designated hitter and pinch hitting duties in 2025.
       During the winter meetings, Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt had an
       encouraging update on Fry, who underwent surgery to repair nasal
       fractures after taking a pitch from Tarik Skubal off his face Sept.
       23. "I'm just excited that David is going to be healthy," Vogt
       said. "David healthy, him being able to catch and play the field a
       little bit, too, probably, it just adds a completely different
       dynamic to our team." With more time removed from the UCL surgery
       he underwent in November of 2024, Fry is expected to resume playing
       defense as a third catcher while also getting time at the corners
       in the infield and outfield. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had
       a .996 OPS against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to
       Guardians, who ranked 27th (.647 OPS) against left-handers in 2025.

       Matt Fraizer PIT CF

Red Sox's Matt Fraizer: Inks deal with Boston
       8h ago
       The Red Sox signed Fraizer to a minor-league deal Thursday, per
       MiLB Central's Chase Ford. Fraizer confirmed the signing on his
       personal Instagram account.
       Fraizer joins a team with an outfield logjam in the majors but
       lacks depth in the minors. He batted .305 with an .813 OPS across
       62 games for Triple-A Indianapolis in 2025. A third-round draft
       pick of the Pirates out of the University of Arizona in 2019,
       Fraizer spent the last half-decade with Pittsburgh's affiliates
       before electing free agency last November. He can play all three
       outfield positions and is expected to do so at Triple-A Worcester
       when the 2026 season opens.

       Marcelo Mayer BOS SS

Red Sox's Marcelo Mayer: Should be ready Opening Day
       8h ago
       Mayer (wrist) is expected to be read for Opening Day, Lauren
       Campbell of MassLive.com reports.
       Mayer is recovering from last August's right wrist arthroscopy that
       ended his season after 44 games. Offseason updates suggested he
       could have played in the postseason had Boston extended its run,
       which suggests Mayer will be available for spring training.
       Depending on roster additions, the 23-year-old infielder could play
       one of three infield positions: second base, shortstop or third
       base. Mayer could return to shortstop, the position he played prior
       to the Red Sox drafting him in 2021, due to a downturn in shortstop
       Trevor Story's defense (minus-9 OAA) in 2025. In that scenario,
       Story would move to second base.

       29m ago
       LaVine (ankle) will not play Friday against the Suns.

Warriors' Trayce Jackson-Davis: Upgraded to available
       33m ago
       Jackson-Davis (knee) is available for Friday's game against the
       Thunder.
       As expected, Jackson-Davis is set to play through a knee issue
       after being listed as probable. The big man has reached the
       20-minute mark just once in his last eight appearances, though an
       uptick in playing time in the frontcourt could be in the cards
       Friday due to the absence of Draymond Green (rest).

Warriors' De'Anthony Melton: Sitting out Friday
       37m ago
       Melton is out for Friday's game against the Thunder due to left
       knee injury management.
       Coming off ACL surgery last year, Melton isn't yet cleared to play
       both ends of back-to-back sets. The expectation is that he'll be
       available Saturday against Utah. The likes of Pat Spencer, Gary
       Payton and Buddy Hield should help fill out the backcourt minutes
       for the short-handed Warriors on Friday.

       Pelle Larsson MIA SG

Heat's Pelle Larsson: Iffy for Saturday
       41m ago
       Larsson is questionable for Saturday's game against Minnesota with
       a right ankle sprain.
       Saturday could be a second consecutive absence for Larsson. If he
       doesn't play, Nikola Jovic (elbow), who's probable, would likely
       pick up a few extra minutes.

Heat's Nikola Jovic: Probable for Saturday
       42m ago
       Jovic (elbow) is probable for Saturday's game against Minnesota.
       Jovic is expected to play through his right elbow issue Saturday
       for the front end of this back-to-back set. Jovic is averaging 14.0
       points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists over his last four outings.

Heat's Jaime Jaquez: Expected to play
       44m ago
       Jaquez is probable for Saturday's game against Minnesota with a
       right thigh contusion.
       This is a new issue for Jaquez, but it's not expected to force him
       to the sideline. Jaquez is averaging 20.1 points, 4.7 assists, 3.9
       rebounds and 0.9 three-pointers on 57.1 percent shooting from the
       field over his last seven outings.

Sharks' Adam Gaudette: Ruled out against Bolts
       3m ago
       Gaudette (lower body) will not be in the lineup for Saturday's
       clash with the Lightning, Curtis Pashelka of The San Jose Mercury
       News reports.
       Gaudette will miss his second straight game due to his lower-body
       issue. While the 29-year-old forward has added just one goal in his
       last 10 outings, he did manage to chip in four helpers, with three
       of those five points coming on the man advantage.

Sharks' John Klingberg: Doubtful for Saturday

       Klingberg (undisclosed) is considered doubtful for Saturday's game
       against Tampa Bay, per Curtis Pashelka of The San Jose Mercury
       News.
       Klingberg has nine goals and 16 points in 31 appearances with the
       Sharks this season. Timothy Liljegren (upper body) is slated to
       return Saturday, so if Klingberg can't play, then his exit from the
       lineup would likely coincide with another defenseman's return.

Red Wings' Ben Chiarot: Gathers helper
       11m ago
       Chiarot notched an assist, three hits and two blocked shots in
       Thursday's 4-3 overtime loss to the Penguins.
       Chiarot ended a 14-game point drought with the helper. His only
       scoring contribution in December was a Dec. 2 goal versus the
       Bruins. The defenseman continues to hold down a shutdown role in
       the Red Wings' top four. He's earned nine points, 48 shots on net,
       40 PIM, 89 hits and 91 blocked shots through 42 appearances this
       season.

Red Wings' Patrick Kane: Snags helper Thursday
       13m ago
       Kane notched an assist and four shots on goal in Thursday's 4-3
       overtime loss to the Penguins.
       This was Kane's first point in three games after missing six
       contests due to an upper-body injury. The 37-year-old has returned
       to a second-line role with power-play time. Kane is at 24 points
       (nine on the power play), 78 shots on net and an even plus-minus
       rating through 27 appearances. He's productive when he's healthy,
       but the injury risk is at least moderate since he's already been
       out of the lineup for two stretches this season.

Red Wings' James van Riemsdyk: Pots power-play goal

       Van Riemsdyk scored a power-play goal on two shots in Thursday's
       4-3 overtime loss to the Penguins.
       Van Riemsdyk has four points over his last five games, including
       two on the power play. The 36-year-old winger isn't a full-time
       player for the Red Wings, but he's been effective as a power-play
       specialist with a fourth-line spot at even strength. He's up to 10
       goals, two assists, 59 shots on net, 20 blocked shots and a
       minus-10 rating over 33 appearances. Van Riemsdyk will continue to
       compete with Elmer Soderblom for playing time.

       18m ago
       Karlsson logged two assists and two blocked shots in Thursday's 4-3
       overtime win over the Red Wings.
       Karlsson's second helper of the game was the 900th point of his NHL
       career. The 35-year-old blueliner had 13 points over 14 outings in
       December and has started January on a high note as well. The
       veteran defenseman is up to 30 points, 86 shots on net, 38 blocked
       shots and a minus-5 rating through 39 appearances in a top-four
       role this season.

       the Panthers, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports.
       Walker exited the game after the opening kickoff. If the
       linebacker's ankle injury ends up being too much to play through,
       his role on special teams will likely be covered by Deion Jones for
       the remainder of Saturday's game.

Cardinals' Tejhaun Palmer: Signs with active roster
       16m ago
       The Cardinals signed Palmer from the practice squad to the active
       roster Saturday ahead of Sunday's game against the Rams.
       Palmer has resided on the Cardinals' practice squad for the
       entirety of the 2025 season, but he will join the active roster for
       the Week 18 divisional contest. The wide receiver will likely
       function as a special-teams reserve player, as he is listed as the
       No. 5 option at receiver behind Michael Wilson, Xavier Weaver,
       Jalen Brooks and Steven Sims.

Cardinals' Steven Sims: Elevated for Week 18
       19m ago
       The Cardinals elevated Sims from the practice squad to the active
       roster Saturday ahead of Sunday's game against the Rams.
       Sims is set to play his third consecutive game for the Cardinals.
       The 28-year-old is likely to serve as the Cardinals' kick and punt
       returner for Sunday's game, as he has logged 187 kick return yards
       and five punt return yards over the last two contests. The wide
       receiver also has upside as the fifth receiving option behind
       Michael Wilson, Xavier Weaver, Jalen Brooks and tight end Trey
       McBride.

Jets' Isaiah Davis: Moved to injured reserve
       27m ago
       Davis (concussion) was placed on injured reserve Saturday.
       Davis was already ruled out for Sunday's regular-season finale
       against the Bills while in the league's concussion protocol. With
       Breece Hall (knee) also ruled out, the Jets will go with three
       running backs on the active roster in Khalil Herbert, Kene Nwangwu
       and practice-squad member Raheem Blackshear. Davis will end the
       2025 season with 43 carries for 236 yards and one touchdown along
       with 21 catches (on 28 targets) for 186 yards across 16 games.

Commanders' River Cracraft: Elevated for Sunday
       28m ago
       The Commanders elevated Cracraft from the practice squad to the
       active roster Saturday ahead of Sunday's game against the Eagles.
       Cracraft has been elevated for consecutive weeks, finishing
       Christmas Day's loss against the Cowboys with just one snap on the
       special-teams unit. With Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Treylon
       Burks and Chris Moore all healthy and active, Cracraft is likely in
       line to see the same minimal special-teams snap share in Sunday's
       game.

Jets' Mason Taylor: Placed on injured reserve
       30m ago
       The Jets placed Taylor (neck) on injured reserve Saturday.
       Taylor was already ruled out for Week 18 against the Bills, but the
       move corresponds with other moves the Jets made ahead of Sunday's
       regular-season finale. The rookie second-rounder ended up missing
       the final four games of the regular season due to a neck injury,
       but he should be healthy for the start of the 2026 campaign. Taylor
       will finish his first NFL season with 44 catches (on 65 targets)
       for 369 yards and one touchdown across 13 games.

Twins' Orlando Arcia: Signs minors deal with Twins
       2h ago
       Arcia signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Saturday,
       Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
       Arcia endured his worst season in the big leagues last year,
       slashing .202/.238/.291 with 13 RBI and 13 runs scored across 214
       plate appearances between Atlanta and Colorado. The 31-year-old
       will have a chance to bounce back in the Twins' farm system, but he
       likely won't act as more than bench depth if he makes it back to
       the majors in 2026.

       The Astros designated Ort (elbow) for assignment Friday, Chandler

       Ort posted a 4.89 ERA and 1.35 WHIP across 46 innings with the
       Astros in 2025 before missing the final month of the season due to
       elbow inflammation. He'll now lose his place on Houston's 40-man

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster
       1d ago
       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       1d ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. Wagaman sported a .283/.321/.462 batting line
       against lefties in 2025, so much of his playing time in Minnesota
       could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Won't be limited to DH in 2026
       1d ago
       Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said earlier this month that Fry
       (face) is expected to resume playing defense during the 2026
       season, Tim Stebbins of MLB.com reports. "I'm just excited that
       David is going to be healthy," Vogt said. "David having a full
       winter, healthy, completed the [throwing] rehab. It's going to be
       really exciting to be able to use him the way his skill set is
       intended."
       After undergoing Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow last
       November, Fry was cleared to make his 2025 debut for the Guardians
       in late May but ended being limited exclusively to
       designated-hitter and pinch-hitting duties throughout the season.
       His campaign came to an early end when he was hit in the face by a
       pitch from the Tigers' Tarik Skubal on Sept. 23, resulting in Fry
       requiring surgery to repair nasal fractures. Vogt suggested that
       Fry has fully healed from that procedure, putting the 30-year-old
       on track to resume duties as the team's third catch while also
       being in the mix for playing time at the infield and outfield
       corners in 2026. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had a .996 OPS
       against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to the
       Guardians, who ranked 27th against left-handers in 2025 with a .647
       OPS.

       1d ago
       Fraizer confirmed Friday via his personal Instagram account that he
       agreed to a minor-league contract with the Red Sox.
       Fraizer joins an organization with an outfield logjam in the majors
       but which lacks depth in the minors. The 27-year-old batted
       .305/.361/.452 with three home runs and 14 stolen bases across 62
       games for Triple-A Indianapolis in the Pirates organization in
       2025.

Magic's Jalen Suggs: Diagnosed with MCL contusion
       2m ago
       Suggs was diagnosed with a Grade 1 MCL contusion in his right knee
       following the Magic's 121-114 loss to the Bulls on Friday.
       There isn't a clear timeline for Suggs' return, as it will depend
       on how his knee reacts to treatment. However, a Grade 1 injury
       typically doesn't carry a long recovery timeline, so he can be
       considered day-to-day unless the Magic say otherwise. Orlando's
       next game takes place Sunday against Indiana, and if Suggs is
       unable to play, then Tyus Jones would be the top candidate to enter
       the Magic's starting five.
