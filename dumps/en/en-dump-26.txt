Classic Fantasy Novels That Aren’t The Lord of the Rings

   If you love the fantasy genre (or want to explore it), add these
   classic fantasy books to your reading list! Perfect for fans of J. R.
   R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, most of these classic fantasy novels were
   written before Narnia and Middle Earth, and helped shape modern fantasy
   literature.
   Butterflies in a room backlit by a window, with the words "Classic
   Fantasy Novels (That Aren't The Lord of the Rings)" superimposed on
   top.

   I grew up steeped in fantasy literature, much of it either written by
   C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, or influenced in some way by those
   two authors. The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of
   Narnia are indeed seminal in the fantasy genre. But of course, Tolkien
   and Lewis were not the first fantasy authors on the scene, even though
   the genre was still pretty new when they were writing.

   If you’ve ever wanted to go beyond the borders of Narnia and Middle
   Earth and journey into other realms of fantasy literature, let this
   list be your guide! The first Narnia book (The Lion, the Witch, and the
   Wardrobe) was published in 1950, and the first installment of The Lord
   of the Rings was published in 1954 (although written earlier). Most of
   the books on this list of classic fantasy novels pre-date both of
   these! I hope you enjoy exploring the following authors and the worlds
   they created.

Best Classic Fantasy Books Every Fan Should Read

Phantastes by George MacDonald (1858)

   On his twenty-first birthday, Anodos inherits an old desk from his late
   father. Upon inspection, he discovers a secret compartment in the desk,
   and to his surprise, a beautiful and ancient fairy lady steps out. She
   promises that he will soon find the path into Fairy Land. Sure enough,
   the next morning his bedroom melts away into a land of streams and
   meadows, and Anodos begins a series of adventures that teach him
   profound truths about love, beauty, temptation, and the self.

   Although George MacDonald is a bit of a “niche” author today, he was
   hugely influential to late 19th-century and 20th-century authors,
   including Lewis Carroll, J. M. Barrie, G. K. Chesterton, Madeleine
   L’Engle, and Ray Bradbury, to name a few. C. S. Lewis said that when he
   read Phantastes at the age of sixteen, he “crossed a great frontier”
   and his imagination was baptized.

   MacDonald wrote Phantastes near the beginning of his literary career,
   and the fantasy novel Lilith near the end. Both have an amazing
   dream-like quality and are rich in symbolism. Although not connected
   they are excellent to read together, as they’re quite distinct from his
   more child-oriented fantasy novels such as The Princess and the Goblin.

The Wood Beyond the World by William Morris (1894)

   After his wife is unfaithful to him, Everyman hero Golden Walter turns
   to the sea for a fresh start. On his journey, he has a vision of a
   powerful sorceress, a beautiful maiden held prisoner, and a dwarf.
   Eventually a storm brings him to their lost and magical land, where
   Walter will encounter many adventures as he seeks to free the maiden.

   Yes, the author of this novel is the same William Morris famous for his
   coveted textile and wallpaper patterns! As an artist, novelist, poet,
   bookmaker, and public speaker, Morris was quite the Renaissance man. In
   addition to The Wood Beyond the World, Morris wrote several other
   fantasy novels, the best of which is probably The Well at the World’s
   End. However, since The Well is much longer than The Wood Beyond the
   World, it makes sense to start with the latter, to get acclimated to
   Morris’s (intentionally) archaic style.

The Worm Ouroboros by E. R. Eddison (1922)

   The Worm Ouroboros is an epic high fantasy novel that tells of a
   sweeping war between the kingdoms of Demonland and Witchland. The
   conflict rages across land and sea, drawing in enemies and allies from
   neighbouring countries like Impland and Pixyland, as well as magical
   creatures such as a hippogriff and a manticore.

   Eddison’s strengths are in his world-building and sheer imagination.
   Some readers find the language difficult, as he chose to write in
   Shakespearean-style English. Eddison was an occasional guest of the
   Inklings literary group, and both J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis were
   avid readers of his work. In addition to The Worm Ouroboros, Eddison
   wrote the Zimiamvian Trilogy, which is loosely related to his earlier
   novel.

The King of Elfland’s Daughter by Lord Dunsany (1924)

   In this fairy tale romance, our world exists side-by-side with Elfland,
   although time passes differently in each. The mortals of Erl, wishing
   to restore the old magic to their land, send the ruler’s son Alveric
   into Elfland to win the hand of the Elven princess, Lirazel. But is
   there a place in our world for a marriage between a mortal man and an
   Elf?

   Although The King of Elfland’s Daughter is Dunsany’s best-known work,
   he was a prolific author, publishing nearly 100 volumes of poetry,
   plays, short stories, science fiction, fantasy, and more.

   Amazon | Bookshop.org
   [svg%3E] [61BIxxYwR2L._SL250_.jpg]

Lud-in-the-Mist by Hope Mirrlees (1926)

   The citizens of Lud-in-the-Mist, in the country of Dorimare, have long
   ago banned all communication and trade with Fairyland, which lies on
   their distant borders. But every now and then, contraband Fairy fruit
   makes its way into Lud. It tastes irresistible, but those who eat of it
   are never the same again.

   The hero of the story ends up being a most unlikely
   specimen–middle-aged Nathaniel Chanticleer, mayor of Lud, and terrified
   of all things Fairy. But when Nathaniel’s own son eats the forbidden
   fruit, the mayor finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of intrigue and
   murder, leading him to question the status quo and make choices he
   never dreamed of facing.

   Although she wrote poetry and two other novels, Lud-in-the-Mist is
   Mirrlee’s only fantasy novel. Nevertheless, her writing had its impact
   on famous authors such as Neil Gaiman and J. K. Rowling, as well as her
   contemporaries and friends T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf.

The Mabinogion Tetralogy by Evangeline Walton (published 1936 and 1970s;
written 1930s-40s)

   The Mabinogion Tetralogy is a collection of four novels based on the
   Welsh Mabinogion mythology, the earliest prose literature of Britain.
   Walton’s series includes Prince of Annwn, The Children of Llyr, The
   Song of Rhiannon, and The Island of the Mighty. Like the original Welsh
   legends, each book is full of enchantments, family drama, castles,
   giants and monsters, and magical transformations. Walton wrote the
   manuscripts in the 1930s and 40s, but when her first book sold poorly
   (despite favorable critical reviews), she tabled the project. In the
   1970s Walton was “rediscovered” and her Mabinogion books were published
   for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series.

   This series is a good pick for fans of T. H. White’s The Once and
   Future King cycle, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain series, and
   Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. (And the latter two, at least, were
   certainly influenced by the original Welsh Mabinogion.)

Classic Fantasy Novels That Aren’t The Lord of the Rings

   If you love the fantasy genre (or want to explore it), add these
   classic fantasy books to your reading list! Perfect for fans of J. R.
   R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, most of these classic fantasy novels were
   written before Narnia and Middle Earth, and helped shape modern fantasy
   literature.
   Butterflies in a room backlit by a window, with the words "Classic
   Fantasy Novels (That Aren't The Lord of the Rings)" superimposed on
   top.

   I grew up steeped in fantasy literature, much of it either written by
   C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, or influenced in some way by those
   two authors. The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Chronicles of
   Narnia are indeed seminal in the fantasy genre. But of course, Tolkien
   and Lewis were not the first fantasy authors on the scene, even though
   the genre was still pretty new when they were writing.

   If you’ve ever wanted to go beyond the borders of Narnia and Middle
   Earth and journey into other realms of fantasy literature, let this
   list be your guide! The first Narnia book (The Lion, the Witch, and the
   Wardrobe) was published in 1950, and the first installment of The Lord
   of the Rings was published in 1954 (although written earlier). Most of
   the books on this list of classic fantasy novels pre-date both of
   these! I hope you enjoy exploring the following authors and the worlds
   they created.

Best Classic Fantasy Books Every Fan Should Read

Phantastes by George MacDonald (1858)

   On his twenty-first birthday, Anodos inherits an old desk from his late
   father. Upon inspection, he discovers a secret compartment in the desk,
   and to his surprise, a beautiful and ancient fairy lady steps out. She
   promises that he will soon find the path into Fairy Land. Sure enough,
   the next morning his bedroom melts away into a land of streams and
   meadows, and Anodos begins a series of adventures that teach him
   profound truths about love, beauty, temptation, and the self.

   Although George MacDonald is a bit of a “niche” author today, he was
   hugely influential to late 19th-century and 20th-century authors,
   including Lewis Carroll, J. M. Barrie, G. K. Chesterton, Madeleine
   L’Engle, and Ray Bradbury, to name a few. C. S. Lewis said that when he
   read Phantastes at the age of sixteen, he “crossed a great frontier”
   and his imagination was baptized.

   MacDonald wrote Phantastes near the beginning of his literary career,
   and the fantasy novel Lilith near the end. Both have an amazing
   dream-like quality and are rich in symbolism. Although not connected
   they are excellent to read together, as they’re quite distinct from his
   more child-oriented fantasy novels such as The Princess and the Goblin.

The Wood Beyond the World by William Morris (1894)

   After his wife is unfaithful to him, Everyman hero Golden Walter turns
   to the sea for a fresh start. On his journey, he has a vision of a
   powerful sorceress, a beautiful maiden held prisoner, and a dwarf.
   Eventually a storm brings him to their lost and magical land, where
   Walter will encounter many adventures as he seeks to free the maiden.

   Yes, the author of this novel is the same William Morris famous for his
   coveted textile and wallpaper patterns! As an artist, novelist, poet,
   bookmaker, and public speaker, Morris was quite the Renaissance man. In
   addition to The Wood Beyond the World, Morris wrote several other
   fantasy novels, the best of which is probably The Well at the World’s
   End. However, since The Well is much longer than The Wood Beyond the
   World, it makes sense to start with the latter, to get acclimated to
   Morris’s (intentionally) archaic style.

The Worm Ouroboros by E. R. Eddison (1922)

   The Worm Ouroboros is an epic high fantasy novel that tells of a
   sweeping war between the kingdoms of Demonland and Witchland. The
   conflict rages across land and sea, drawing in enemies and allies from
   neighbouring countries like Impland and Pixyland, as well as magical
   creatures such as a hippogriff and a manticore.

   Eddison’s strengths are in his world-building and sheer imagination.
   Some readers find the language difficult, as he chose to write in
   Shakespearean-style English. Eddison was an occasional guest of the
   Inklings literary group, and both J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis were
   avid readers of his work. In addition to The Worm Ouroboros, Eddison
   wrote the Zimiamvian Trilogy, which is loosely related to his earlier
   novel.

The King of Elfland’s Daughter by Lord Dunsany (1924)

   In this fairy tale romance, our world exists side-by-side with Elfland,
   although time passes differently in each. The mortals of Erl, wishing
   to restore the old magic to their land, send the ruler’s son Alveric
   into Elfland to win the hand of the Elven princess, Lirazel. But is
   there a place in our world for a marriage between a mortal man and an
   Elf?

   Although The King of Elfland’s Daughter is Dunsany’s best-known work,
   he was a prolific author, publishing nearly 100 volumes of poetry,
   plays, short stories, science fiction, fantasy, and more.

Lud-in-the-Mist by Hope Mirrlees (1926)

   The citizens of Lud-in-the-Mist, in the country of Dorimare, have long
   ago banned all communication and trade with Fairyland, which lies on
   their distant borders. But every now and then, contraband Fairy fruit
   makes its way into Lud. It tastes irresistible, but those who eat of it
   are never the same again.

   The hero of the story ends up being a most unlikely
   specimen–middle-aged Nathaniel Chanticleer, mayor of Lud, and terrified
   of all things Fairy. But when Nathaniel’s own son eats the forbidden
   fruit, the mayor finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of intrigue and
   murder, leading him to question the status quo and make choices he
   never dreamed of facing.

   Although she wrote poetry and two other novels, Lud-in-the-Mist is
   Mirrlee’s only fantasy novel. Nevertheless, her writing had its impact
   on famous authors such as Neil Gaiman and J. K. Rowling, as well as her
   contemporaries and friends T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf.

The Mabinogion Tetralogy by Evangeline Walton (published 1936 and 1970s;
written 1930s-40s)

   The Mabinogion Tetralogy is a collection of four novels based on the
   Welsh Mabinogion mythology, the earliest prose literature of Britain.
   Walton’s series includes Prince of Annwn, The Children of Llyr, The
   Song of Rhiannon, and The Island of the Mighty. Like the original Welsh
   legends, each book is full of enchantments, family drama, castles,
   giants and monsters, and magical transformations. Walton wrote the
   manuscripts in the 1930s and 40s, but when her first book sold poorly
   (despite favorable critical reviews), she tabled the project. In the
   1970s Walton was “rediscovered” and her Mabinogion books were published
   for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series.

   This series is a good pick for fans of T. H. White’s The Once and
   Future King cycle, Lloyd Alexander’s Chronicles of Prydain series, and
   Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. (And the latter two, at least, were
   certainly influenced by the original Welsh Mabinogion.)
