Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   Two
   studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials in
   relevant fantasy contexts
   on childrenʼs motivation and learning. In Study 1, Ss showed marked
   preferences for computer-
   based educational programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2,

   identical
   problems within fantasy
   contexts.
   Some

   chose among

   fantasies; others
   were
   assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experi-
   mental sessions. Ss showed significantly greater learning and transfer
   in the fantasy than in the

   discussed.
   Ask a group of college students to describe their most memo-
   rable and significant learning experiences in their elementary-
   school years and one discovers some interesting recollections.
   One student may remember the third-grade classroom in which
   the teacher played the role of a "crooked" shopkeeper, cajoling
   delighted students to add, subtract, multiply, and divide accu-
   rately, lest they find themselves short-changed on their pur-
   chases. Another may recall the history teacher who had stu-
   dents prepare a Renaissance banquet, complete with appro-
   priate food, music, costumes, and entertainment. Still another
   may speak of the social studies class in which the students held
   their own Constitutional Convention.
   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   conviction that such procedures may not only make education
   more enjoyable but may also enhance studentsʼ learning—that
   children learn best, most effectively and most lastingly, when
   they are intrinsically motivated to learn. If
   so,
   then increasing
   the motivational appeal of an educational activity should in-
   deed increase learning as well.
   Such a general relationship has been postulated by a number
   of theorists (e.g., Bruner, 1961; Condry, 1977; Deci, 1975; Lep-
   per & Greene,
   1978;
   Singer, 1973,1977), but there is little experi-
   mental evidence to support this contention (Lepper & Hodell,
   1989).
   To be sure, correlational studies in several areas have
   shown significant positive relationships between how interest-
   ing children say they find particular educational materials and
   how much they learn and recall from those materials (e.g.,
   Asher, 1979,1980; Asher & Markell, 1974; see also Anderson,
   Shirey, Wilson, & Fielding, 1987), but these studies contain no
   evidence to establish that the interest value of the material was
   a determinant, and not a consequence, of learning.1
   Of course, this lack of relevant experimental evidence may
   reflect, in part, the difficulty of varying the motivational ap-
   peal of an educational activity without varying other instruc-
   tional features of that activity as well. That is, many of the
   modifications that one could make to enhance the degree of
   challenge or the amount of curiosity a particular educational
   activity might produce would simultaneously alter the essential
   nature of the exercises or the instruction provided. Likewise,
   1 Moreover, these positive correlations may be a simple function of
   increased time spent on more interesting materials. For
   example,
   in at
   least one major survey in which the use of more highly motivating
   educational activities was not confounded with increased time spent
   on the topic
   itself,
   a significant negative relationship was found be-
   tween the reported
   use
   of such activities and measured student achieve-
   ment (Baker, Herman, & Yeh, 1981).

   demonstrations of the detrimental effects of extrinsic rewards
   (e.g., Lepper, 1988), competition (e.g., Ames, 1984), or a perfor-
   mance focus
   (e.g.,
   Dweck, 1986) on motivation and learning do
   not necessarily prove that increases in the motivational appeal
   of an activity will have corresponding positive effects on learn-
   ing. In each case, it would be difficult to determine whether
   subsequent differences in learning were the result of increases
   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone
   (1987),
   for
   example,
   have
   elaborated several mechanisms whereby enhanced interest in
   an educational activity may lead to increased learning from
   that activity—mechanisms that may be summarized as focus-
   ing the learnerʼs attention on relevant learning opportunities
   and increasing depth of involvement with, and investment of
   mental effort in, the educational aspects of the activity (cf.
   Condry, 1977; Corno & Mandinach, 1983; Salomon, 1983).
   Such beneficial effects on learning are predicted to occur, how-
   ever, only when the motivational embellishments reinforce and
   support the instructional goals of the activity. This should
   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
   ment that can be added without necessitating changes in the
   basic instructional content of
   the
   activities. Thus, this particu-
   lar strategy for enhancing student interest permits one to com-
   pare the effects of different versions of
   a
   common educational
   activity, holding constant the problems presented, the instruc-
   tion given, the feedback provided, and so forth. Hence, this
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
   strategy
   also
   permits an exami-
   nation of the potential effects on learning of motivational indi-
   vidualization of an educational activity.3
   In this article, we report two studies derived from this basic
   analysis. In each, we compared the effects of four versions of a
   series of computer-based educational activities designed to
   teach children
   basic
   graphics programming in Logo—a pro-
   gramming language designed, in part, to promote planning,
   problem solving, and mathematical skills in young children
   (e.g., Papert, 1980; Papert, Watt, diSessa, & Weir, 1979). In a
   basal, unembellished version of these activities, a progression
   of problems was presented in abstract form, involving simple
   line drawings and geometric
   shapes.
   In the other
   three
   versions,
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-
   mediate learning was assessed by traditional paper-and-pencil
   exams administered the day after the completion of these les-
   sons;
   retention of
   the
   material was assessed 2 weeks later.
   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach
   children the use of
   basic
   graphics commands in the program-
   ming language Logo were created. All four versions involved an
   identical series of lessons asking children to perform various
   graphics programming tasks. In the basal version of the pro-
   gram, these activities were presented in the form of straightfor-
   ward geometric problems (e.g., how to navigate oneʼs way
   through a maze); in the other three
   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each
   2 Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide examples of the
   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present
   cases,
   these
   two
   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.
   3 Although some common motivational benefits of fantasy involve-
   ment have been observed, differences in the specific fantasies that
   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound
   (e.g., Malone
   &
   Lepper,
   1987;
   Singer, 1973,1977).

   series of programs and were asked first to rank order these
   programs and later to select one set of programs for their
   own use.
   Method
   Participants
   The sample included 24 male and 23 female third- and fourth-grade
   students from three parochial schools (two Catholic and one Episco-
   pal)
   in the San
   Francisco
   Bay
   Area
   of
   California. These children
   ranged in age from
   8
   to
   10
   years (M= 8.81, SD
   = .54)
   and came from a
   broad range
   of
   socioeconomic backgrounds. They participated,
   in
   small groups of 2 or 3,
   in
   two experimental sessions each.
   Instructional Programs
   The four sets of computer-based instructional programs all involved
   a series
   of
   formally identical activities requiring the student to make
   use
   of
   basic graphics commands
   in
   Logo. These activities required
   children to learn (a) how to draw lines connecting various collections
   of objects on the screen, (b) how to negotiate a passage through a
   series
   of mazes displayed on the screen, and
   (c)
   how to construct
   a
   prescribed
   series of simple geometric shapes on the screen.
   In
   the basal, no-fan-
   tasy version
   of
   this activity, each
   of
   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or
   herself as a pirate in search of buried treasure. In another, the child
   was
   placed
   in
   the role
   of
   a detective hunting down criminals;
   in
   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would
   be asked to "go meet the other astronauts and bring them back to the
   ship"
   displayed in the center of the screen. Similarly, in a next activity
   in which students
   in
   the no-fantasy version were asked
   to
   connect
   a
   series of circles with a single line, student-astronauts would be asked
   to
   explore
   a
   series of
   planets.
   Parallel embellishments
   in
   the other cases
   featured stories
   and
   illustrations involving pirates
   or
   detectives.
   A
   more detailed description of the precise series of lessons is included
   in
   the description of Study 2.
   Procedure
   Session 1. During
   the
   initial session, children were first given
   a
   30-min introduction
   to
   the Logo graphics commands they would
   be
   asked
   to
   work with. Following this lesson, the children were given
   a
   brief demonstration that provided highlights from each of the four sets
   of instructional activities. Order
   of
   presentation
   of
   the four versions
   was counterbalanced so that each version appeared equally often
   in
   each of the four positions in the demonstration. Each
   was
   presented
   for
   an approximately equal amount of time.
   After viewing the demonstration, undergraduate research assistants
   interviewed the children individually and asked the following:
   Of the four computer games you saw: (1) Which one would you
   most like to play? Which one do you like the best?
   (2)
   Which one
   would you like second best? (3) Which one would you like third
   best? and (4) Which one would you like the least?
   This interview provided
   us
   with
   a
   self-report measure
   of
   childrenʼs
   relative preferences for the four versions of the learning activities.
   Session
   2.
   Two
   days after the initial session, children were recruited
   for a second session. In this session, children were given a consequen-
   tial choice
   of
   activities.
   In
   particular, the children were asked, "Re-
   member the games you played last time? Which one would you like to
   play today?" Their choices were recorded and served as
   a
   behavioral
   measure of intrinsic motivation. Children were allowed to work on the
   computer, with the activity of their choice, for approximately 40 min.
   Results
   The results of Study
   1
   confirm the anticipated motivational
   benefits of embedding identical instructional activities in fan-
   tasy
   contexts.
   Even the simple embellishments used in the pres-
   ent study seemed to produce significant effects on childrenʼs
   stated preferences for the different learning
   activities.
   As
   shown
   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-
   sions of the learning activity were significantly higher than the
   mean ranking of the no-fantasy version,
   t(46) =
   7.80, p <
   .001;
   t(46) =
   6.99, p <
   .001;
   and /(46) = 3.92, p <
   .001,
   for compari-
   sons of the no-fantasy version with the
   detective,
   the pirate, and
   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,
   and 27.6% chose the pirate, detective, and space ver-
   sions,
   respectively, x2
   (3,
   N = 47) = 9.43, p < .05. As might be
   expected, childrenʼs stated preferences in the first session
   proved highly correlated with their choices in the second ses-
   sion. Only 4 students chose an activity that they had not previ-
   ously rated as their top choice.
   Finally, on neither measure were there any preference differ-
   ences between boys and
   girls;
   both showed the same preference
   for the fantasy versions of the activity. In addition, on neither
   measure did there appear to be any dramatic differences in the
   appeal of the various fantasy versions of the learning activities.
   Instead, childrenʼs specific fantasy preferences seemed nearly

   evenly spread across the three fantasies, thus setting the stage
   for our second study.
   Study 2: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Learning
   What difference, then, does it make if learning is more fun?
   Will children given equal exposure to different versions of
   identical instructional activities show different levels of learn-
   ing as a function of the motivational appeal of those activities?
   In view of the demonstrated increases in interest produced in
   Study
   1
   by the addition of simple fantasy embellishments, in
   Study 2, we examined the consequences for learning of these
   differences in motivational appeal, controlling for the time
   spent with the learning activities.
   Thus,
   Study 2 examined the effects on childrenʼs learning of
   embedding identical instructional materials in the various fan-
   tasy contexts examined in Study 1. In this second experiment,
   third-grade children worked, during four successive training
   sessions, with graphics commands from the Logo program-
   ming language, under one of three conditions. In a no-fantasy
   control condition, students were given a series of abstract prob-
   lems to solve during four instructional sessions. In two fantasy
   conditions, the identical problems were presented within a fan-
   tasy problem-solving context. In one of these groups, children
   were given their choice of three alternative fantasy contexts; in
   the other, children were assigned specific fantasies yoked to the
   choices of the other group. Children were tested, before and
   after exposure to these treatments, on their knowledge of Logo
   and of several underlying geometric concepts, providing an as-
   sessment of their learning from these different programs. Their
   retention of the material was examined 2 weeks later.
   Method
   Participants
   The sample included
   19
   male
   and
   13 female third-grade students
   from
   a
   private Catholic elementary school
   in the
   San Francisco Bay
   Area of California. These
   32
   children were randomly assigned, within
   sex,
   to
   one of three
   conditions:
   individualized
   fantasy,
   assigned fantasy,
   and no
   fantasy.
   Five children
   did not
   complete all seven sessions,
   so
   their data were
   not
   included.
   In the
   final sample, there were 10 chil-
   dren
   in the
   individualized-fantasy condition
   (6
   boys
   and 4
   girls),
   10
   children
   in
   the assigned-fantasy condition (5 boys and 5 girls),
   and 7
   children
   in the
   no-fantasy condition
   (5
   boys
   and 2
   girls). These
   27
   children in the
   final
   sample ranged in
   age
   from
   8
   to
   10 years
   (M= 8.77,
   SD
   =
   0.65) and came from predominantly lower-middle-income back-
   grounds,
   as
   estimated from parental occupations. None
   of
   the chil-
   dren, according to their parents,
   had
   prior programming experience.
   Experimenters
   The experimenters were six undergraduate psychology majors who
   administered
   all the
   lessons
   and
   assisted with pre-
   and
   posttesting.
   These experimenters first spent
   2 to 3
   hours learning Logoʼs basic
   commands.
   In
   addition, they spent approximately 6 hours practicing
   administering the lessons to each other, Louise Parker, and two pilot
   subjects. Louise Parker was also present
   at
   the school and assisted,
   if
   needed, with
   all
   pre-
   and posttests and with lesson administration.
   Procedure
   Session
   1:
   Pretest.
   The
   first
   session was devoted to pretesting. Prior
   to testing, all children were told that the experimenter
   was
   interested
   in how children learn with computers,
   and
   every effort was made
   to
   minimize perceptions of evaluative pressure. This was done by enlist-
   ing the children as our "assistants"
   in
   helping us to find out how well
   our new computer activities worked. Children were then pretested on
   their knowledge of basic geometric concepts underlying simple graph-
   ics programming in Logo
   (e.g.,
   estimation of line length and angle size
   and ability
   to
   follow directions), using
   a
   test that was based on mea-
   sures developed by Papert etal. (1979) and Milojkovic
   (1983/1984).
   In
   addition
   to
   these pretest measures, composite national percentile
   scores on a standardized school achievement measure, the California
   Test
   of
   Basic
   Skills, (CTBS), were available for all students.
   Children also filled
   out
   several pretest measures
   of
   their general
   academic motivation, including abbreviated versions
   of
   Harterʼs
   In-
   trinsic Motivation (1981)
   and
   Perceived Competence (1982) Scales,
   and they completed additional items measuring their self-rated enjoy-
   ment
   of,
   and self-perceived competence in, academic subjects. Scales
   of test anxiety (Sarason, Lighthall, Davidson,
   Waite,
   &
   Ruebush, 1960)
   and locus
   of
   control
   for
   academic achievement outcomes (Crandall,
   Katovsky, & Crandall, 1965) were also administered. All instructions
   and questions
   for
   these measures were read aloud,
   and the
   experi-
   menters assisted children
   who
   were having difficulty following
   in-
   structions. Total testing time was approximately 30 min.
   These affective and motivational pretest measures were included
   to
   examine the possibility that our experimental effects might differ
   as
   a
   function
   of
   prior differences
   in
   childrenʼs motivational orientations.
   Using median splits
   for
   each
   of
   these measures, however,
   the
   data
   revealed
   no
   significant interactions of these prior motivational orienta-
   tions with experimental conditions. Hence, these measures
   are not
   discussed further.
   Sessions
   2
   through
   5: The
   lessons.
   In
   the second through
   fifth
   ses-
   sions,
   children received instruction
   in the
   elementary concepts
   in-
   volved in using Logo turtle graphics (Papert,
   1980;
   Papert et
   al.,
   1979)
   and were asked
   to
   complete
   a
   graded progression
   of
   exercises using
   what they had been taught. Children participated, in groups of
   5
   or 6,
   in experimental sessions on
   4
   consecutive
   days.
   During these sessions,
   each child worked
   at a
   separate Apple 11+ computer,
   and
   each child
   was assigned
   an
   experimenter who
   sat
   with that child
   and
   provided
   assistance if needed.
   During Session
   2,
   all children were given a common introduction
   to
   the commands that they could use
   to
   move the cursor forward, back-
   ward, left, and right to make line drawings on the
   screen.
   The children
   were also taught commands that sent the cursor
   "home"
   to the middle
   of the screen and that erased the screen entirely. This lesson
   proceeded
   slowly and lasted approximately
   30
   min.
   At the end of the instructional
   period,
   a
   test was administered
   to
   ensure that all children
   had
   mas-
   tered these basic
   commands.
   All children
   were
   successful. During this
   first lesson, the experimenters remained blind to experimental condi-
   tion. At the end of the session, the experimenters opened sealed enve-
   lopes containing childrenʼs assignments to conditions.
   At this point, the treatment of children began to differ
   by
   condition.
   Children assigned to the individualized-fantasy condition were inter-
   viewed individually and told the following:
   When you come back next time, you can play one of these com-
   puter
   activities.
   Listen carefully
   so
   that you can pick which one of
   these activities you want to do when we meet next
   time.
   \bu
   will
   be doing the same activity on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
   afternoon.
   So,
   think carefully about which activity you would like
   to do the most.
   The experimenters then showed and read the following list of choices
   to the children: (1) Pirate Treasure Hunt (in this activity, pirates
   travel

   MAKING LEARNING MORE FUN629
   around and hunt for
   treasure),
   (2)
   Mission
   Space
   Search
   (in
   this activity,
   astronauts
   fly
   around and look for new
   planets),
   and
   (3)
   Clue Detective
   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.
   For students in these
   groups, for
   instance,
   mazes became
   catacombs,
   secret
   passages,
   or city
   streets.
   Overall, the differences between the fantasy and no-fantasy lessons
   were
   quite
   subtle.
   Three stories that corresponded
   to
   the three fantasies
   —pirates, space, and detectives—and that used the exercises as plot
   devices were written. Following a sentence or two introducing each
   fantasy, these stories differed only in the substitution of phrases
   (e.g.,
   "land on each planet" vs. "touch each circle"). The stories continued
   over the course of the
   lessons
   and
   were
   simply illustrated. For example,
   in the pirates story, the circles in the first exercise were replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of
   pirates.
   At the center of the screen was a line
   drawing of a pirate
   ship.
   Instead of being asked simply to connect the
   circles to the central point, children were asked to "go meet the other
   pirates and bring them back to the
   ship."
   Similarly, in a later connect-
   the-circles game, computer-drawn treasure islands that the children
   were asked to visit and plunder replaced the
   circles.
   Subsequently, one
   of the mazes was said to represent a winding tunnel and the other the
   inside of an evil wizardʼs treasure-laden castle. At the end of a final
   lesson, the pirates discovered that their ship had been wrecked, and
   the shape commands were offered as a more efficient means of "re-
   building" or redrawing the
   ship.
   The other fantasies used the exercises
   in a similar manner
   (e.g.,
   circles were replaced by planets and a rocket
   ship in the space story). In addition, in each of these cases, the
   cursor
   was given a name and served as the protagonist of the fantasy.
   More specifically, in Session 3, children were presented with three
   structured
   exercises.
   In the
   first,
   five
   Gircles
   appeared in
   a
   semicircle in
   the upper half of the screen, and students were instructed to connect
   the circles. In the second, children were asked to connect six circles
   placed in a full circle covering both halves of the screen. In the
   third,
   children were asked to navigate a maze by giving directions to the
   cursor. The maze was designed such that children could not take
   "short cuts" through the walls. If they attempted to do so or did so by
   accident, they would "bounce"
   back.
   Finally,
   children
   were
   given some
   time during which they could practice the commands they had learned
   by making up their own game until the end of the
   session.
   This lesson
   took approximately 40 min.4
   During Session
   4,
   the children
   were
   asked to navigate
   a
   second maze
   and to draw various geometric shapes. They were then given circular
   stickers of several colors which they could place on the screen to en-
   hance their drawings. In the no-fantasy condition, all of the stickers
   that the children received were unadorned; in the fantasy
   conditions,
   a
   few of the stickers had been embellished with simple icons relevant to
   the fantasy
   (e.g.,
   a treasure chest or
   a
   deserted
   island).
   It
   was
   hoped that
   the use of stickers would make the play more involving. At the end of
   this lesson there
   was
   a free-drawing period. This lesson took approxi-
   mately 40 min.
   Finally, in Session 5, the children were given more practice with
   drawing shapes. They were also taught several special shape com-
   mands that are not an inherent part of the Logo programming lan-
   guage but that were created specifically for this experiment. At the
   end
   of this last instructional session, there was again a brief period of
   unstructured activity. This last lesson took approximately 30 min.
   Sessions 6 and
   7:
   Posttesting.
   During Session 6, held on the day
   immediately after the last lesson, children were tested on their knowl-
   edge of
   Logo
   turtle graphics. The Logo Turtle Graphics Test (LTGT)
   developed for this purpose involved eight programming problems de-
   signed to assess childrenʼs understanding of, and ability to use, all
   the
   Logo procedures they had been taught. Half of these items asked stu-
   dents to give the commands necessary to produce a given picture; the
   other half asked students to draw the picture that would be produced
   by a given series of
   commands.
   This test constituted our measure of
   direct learning. The more abstract Geometric Concepts Test (GCT)
   was also readministered, to test for generalized learning.
   In addition to these learning measures, several additional attitu-
   dinal measures were administered. Children in all conditions were
   asked to answer, using 11 -point Likert scales (from
   0 = not at
   all to
   10
   =
   very very
   much),
   how much would they like to take another computer
   class,
   how much they liked the computer games they had played, and
   how much they liked working with the computer. For children in the
   two fantasy conditions, an additional question asked how much they
   liked the story that went with the computer games. Finally, two addi-
   tional questions asked for relative evaluations of how the computer
   activity compared with childrenʼs favorite board games and with their
   favorite subjects in school. On both of these last items, children were
   asked to indicate if the computer activity was
   (1)
   a
   lot more
   fun, (2) a
   little more
   fun, (3)
   as much
   fun,
   (4)
   almost as
   much
   fun, (5) a
   little less
   fun,
   or
   (6)
   a
   lot less
   fun.
   During Session 7, which took place 2 weeks after the last lesson,
   both the GCT and the LTGT were administered a final time. Thus,
   both immediate and delayed posttests of learning were obtained. The
   maximum score on the GCT was 43. The maximum score on the
   LTGT was 24. In addition, during this last session, one set of self-re-
   port measures initially included in the pretest battery was readminis-
   tered. Thus, students were asked to report on their liking for, and
   their
   perceived competence at, school mathematics and school in general.
   Results
   Preliminary Analyses
   Initial analyses were performed to determine whether there
   were interactions between experimental condition and either
   studentsʼ gender or their general academic achievement
   (as
   as-
   sessed by their CTBS
   scores).
   In neither analysis was there any
   evidence of an interaction of these variables with experimental
   condition. Therefore, the data were collapsed across both
   gender and initial achievement scores. As expected, however,
   CTBS scores did prove correlated with each of our cognitive
   pre-
   and posttest measures. As a result, these scores were em-
   ployed as a covariate for analyses on those measures.
   4 Note that these short unstructured activity periods were
   fixed
   and
   of equivalent length for all students. Hence, they do not provide a
   measure of student choice or persistence that could serve as a further
   indicator of studentsʼ intrinsic motivation.

   In addition, preliminary analyses revealed no significant
   dif-
   ferences
   on any
   of the measures between students
   in
   the individ-
   ualized-fantasy
   and the
   assigned-fantasy conditions.
   For pur-
   poses
   of
   further analysis, then, these
   two
   groups were
   com-
   bined, providing
   a
   comparison between children
   in
   the fantasy
   versus
   the
   no-fantasy conditions.
   Specific Learning
   The most direct test of our hypotheses concerning the effects
   of fantasy contexts
   on
   learning involved
   a
   comparison
   of
   the
   performance
   of
   students working with
   and
   without
   a
   fantasy
   context
   on
   measures
   of
   their learning
   of
   the specific material
   they had been taught.
   In
   the present
   case,
   these questions were
   best addressed
   by the
   data from
   the
   LTGT.
   Immediate
   learning
   of material.
   To
   examine
   the
   effects
   of
   fantasy context
   on
   childrenʼs understanding
   of, and
   ability
   to
   use,
   the
   material explicitly presented to them,
   a
   one-way analy-
   sis
   of covariance (ANCOVA) was computed on childrenʼs scores
   on
   the
   LTGT, using childrenʼs
   CTBS
   math
   scores as a
   covariate.

   of
   Table

   presents
   the

   for
   this analysis. As hypothesized, students
   in
   the fantasy conditions showed significantly more learning than
   those

   no-fantasy condition,

   Retention
   of material. Given these significant effects
   on ini-
   tial learning,
   it
   is
   of
   interest
   to
   know how effectively this initial
   learning was retained
   2
   weeks later. Hence,
   a
   comparable one-
   way ANCOVA, again using CTBS math scores
   as a
   covariate,
   was done using studentsʼ subsequent retention
   of
   the material
   taught
   as the
   dependent measure.
   On the
   delayed Logo post-
   test, once again, children
   in the
   fantasy conditions performed
   better than those
   in the
   no-fantasy condition,
   F(l,
   24)
   =
   4.93,
   p <
   .05, as shown
   in the

   of

   In addition
   to
   these measures
   of
   the
   specific material taught
   to students, both
   the
   pre-

   posttests included measures
   of
   studentsʼ understanding
   of

   Self-Report Measures
   Three clusters
   of
   self-report measures were also obtained
   at
   the
   end of
   the
   last session.
   A
   first
   pair
   of
   measures asked chil-
   dren directly how much they liked "the games they played" and
   "working with
   the
   computer."
   On
   these measures,
   a
   clear ceil-
   ing effect
   was
   obtained. Over 80%
   of all
   subjects responded
   with the top
   rating;
   means ranged from 9.30 to 9.42 and did not
   differ by condition.
   The last self-report measures, administered
   2
   weeks later,
   asked students to rate their liking for, and competence
   at,
   math-
   ematics
   and
   school
   in
   general.
   Using the
   pretest
   scores
   available
   on this measure as
   a
   covariate,
   the
   results more closely resem-
   bled
   our
   learning effects (M= 24.58
   for
   the fantasy conditions,
   and
   M
   =
   18.90 for the
   no-fantasy condition). However, these
   differences, although more pronounced, also
   did not
   achieve
   statistical significance,
   F(l,
   14)
   =
   2.52,
   p
   =
   .125.
   Finally,
   we
   examined studentsʼ records during
   the
   learning
   sessions
   for evidence of greater interest or involvement. Unfortu-
   nately
   our
   "automated" recording system broke down early,
   leaving us with limited data from only half our subjects
   (9
   in the
   fantasy condition
   and
   5
   in
   the no-fantasy condition). Nonethe-
   less,
   we did
   find evidence
   of our
   fantasy condition subjects
   proving more effective
   (M=
   4.44)
   in
   the central task of the first
   learning session (touching
   a
   series
   of
   circles)
   than
   our
   no-fan-
   tasy condition subjects
   (M=
   2.60),
   t{\2)
   =
   2.26,
   p
   <
   .05.
   That
   this finding
   may
   have been
   the
   result
   of
   a
   deeper involvement
   by the fantasy condition subjects
   is
   further suggested
   by
   the fact
   that all four
   of
   the
   students who succeeded
   at
   this task without
   misses
   or
   backtracking were
   in the
   fantasy conditions.

   MAKING LEARNING MORE FUN631
   General Discussion
   Taken together, the present results demonstrate that in-
   creased learning may occur when instructional materials are
   made more intrinsically motivating for students. In particular,
   these findings illustrate two important benefits of
   the
   instruc-
   tional strategy of embedding educational materials in appeal-
   ing fantasy contexts. First, the findings of Study
   1
   suggest that
   the addition of even relatively minimal fantasy embellishments
   can significantly enhance the motivational appeal of common
   educational activities for children. In situations in which chil-
   dren may be allowed to determine how much time they spend
   with different activities, such differences in interest may ulti-
   mately result in differences in learning, simply as a function of
   the amount of time children spend with the activity. At the
   same time, the results of Study 2 provide evidence of an even
   more profound effect on learning of embedding instructional
   materials in
   a
   fantasy
   context.
   Even when the time that students
   were allowed to spend at the activity
   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.
   Interestingly, these effects appeared equally strong, in the
   present
   studies,
   whether students
   were
   allowed
   to
   select
   an
   indi-
   vidualized fantasy or were assigned a fantasy independent of
   their particular preferences. In
   this
   context,
   however, it
   is
   worth
   noting that our
   sample
   of fantasies
   was small
   and that the fanta-
   sies we
   used
   were
   deliberately chosen
   to be
   of general applicabil-
   ity and appeal. Had the range of options included fantasies that
   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.
   Alternative Mechanisms
   Although we have concentrated on the manner in which the
   provision of a fantasy context
   may
   enhance learning
   by
   increas-
   ing the childʼs level of motivation, it is possible that there are
   also other, more purely cognitive, processes that may have con-
   tributed to the observed effects. Obviously, there
   is a
   large litera-
   ture attesting to the power of visual imagery
   (e.g.,
   Bower, 1972;
   Paivio, 1971), the importance of
   having
   a coherent perspective
   or point of view (e.g., Anderson & Pichert, 1978; Pichert &
   Anderson, 1977), and the significance of a concrete representa-
   tion of problems (e.g., Anderson, 1980; Schoenfeld, 1985) as
   determinants of recall in humans.
   However, the present studies would seem a priori to provide
   a setting in which one might least expect such effects to be
   important. First, there were few explicit memory demands in-
   volved in the learning tasks; indeed, the relevant commands
   remained posted during both the training session and the test-
   ing sessions. It was, instead, the procedural knowledge of
   how
   to use those basic commands efficiently that was at issue for
   these students. Second, as is the case with any use of Logo
   graphics, the task itself
   was
   inherently concrete and
   visual,
   even
   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as
   is
   also the case with nor-
   mal classes in Logo, students in the no-fantasy condition, as
   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to
   "take the point of
   view"
   of
   the
   cursor and to move themselves
   about as they had instructed the cursor to
   move,
   as
   a device for
   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
   1990; Rogoff
   &
   Lave, 1984). In this
   literature, a common finding is that people frequently perform
   tasks quite competently and successfully in concrete and highly
   familiar situations that they are unable to perform when those
   tasks are presented out of context, as on traditional paper-and-
   pencil tests of
   the
   material presented in school.
   In the present case, however, our significant learning results
   appear on measures involving precisely the sort of abstract and
   decontextualized paper-and-pencil tests on which, in
   the
   every-
   day cognition literature, one does not normally find effects.
   Coupled with our data showing
   some
   generalization of learning
   —on even more abstract and out-of-context tests administered
   2 weeks later—the present findings seem more contradictory
   to,
   then derivable from, the everyday cognition literature.
   Educational Implications
   Whatever the underlying mechanisms, the present findings
   have implications for the design of instructional materials and
   exercises for children. Certainly, the motivational and instruc-
   tional benefits observed are consistent with recent calls for the
   reemergence of a "project-centered" approach to curriculum
   design
   (e.g.,
   Katz
   &
   Chard, 1989), in which instructional objec-
   tives are
   integrated into meaningful long-term
   activities
   deliber-
   ately designed and selected for their potential to sustain high
   levels of intrinsic interest.
   Our findings also have the special relevance for the domain
   of computer-based education. In the current studies, the use of
   the computer
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,
   books, peers, television, or any other medium of learn-
   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay
   &
   Sherwood, in
   press;
   Dugdale & Kibbey, 1980; Snyder
   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
   1983;
   Greenfield,
   1984;
   Lepper, 1985).
   Whereas proponents have been quick to note the motivational
   advantages of such procedures (e.g., Lesgold, 1982; Loftus &
   Loftus,
   1983;
   Snyder
   &
   Palmer, 1986), opponents have viewed
   such attempts to "sugarcoat" instruction as ill-advised and
   likely to produce less lasting and less efficient learning (e.g.,

   Bowers,
   1988;
   DAttore,
   1981;
   Psotka,
   1982).
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
   be
   clear about the evident
   limitations of the present effects, because quite obviously the
   mere presentation of abstract problems in the form of
   a
   story
   will guarantee neither increased interest nor enhanced learn-
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
   the teaching of mathematics (e.g., Resnick & Ford, 1981;
   Schoenfeld, 1985). On the one hand, in the typical mathemati-
   cal word problem, the use of a story creates
   a
   dramatic increase
   in the difficulty of the studentsʼ task, because they must now
   translate the story into an equation before attempting to solve
   that equation. On the other hand, the stories used in these
   problems are also virtually devoid of interest value. There are
   no characters with whom students would identify, no meaning-
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;
   clearly, the most vocal proponents of project-centered curricula
   have focused on schooling in the elementary years. Whether
   there are fundamental differences in the processes involved or
   simply an increase in the complexity and richness required for
   a
   fantasy to
   be
   of interest to older students remains an interesting
   topic for future study.
   On the other hand, it is equally clear that the need for tech-
   niques to enhance student interest in traditional educational
   materials may actually increase with age. Young children, for
   example, seem continuously involved in learning; indeed, the
   idea of a preschooler displaying "motivational difficulties" in
   learning to walk, to talk, or to explore
   his
   or her environment is
   almost unthinkable. By contrast, as children progress through
   school "motivation" seems increasingly likely to be identified as
   "a problem." (Holt, 1964; Jackson, 1968; Lepper & Greene,
   1978;
   Silberman, 1970). In fact, explicit survey data obtained
   from school-age students display a continuing decrease in re-
   ported intrinsic motivation toward school work from grade
   three through grade nine (Harter, 1981).
   In part, such discouraging trends may be a consequence of
   the progressive "decontextualization" of learning that occurs as
   students move from grade to grade (Bruner, 1961, 1966;
   Condry, 1977). Both the sorts of projects commonly recalled in
   the reminiscences of students discussed in the beginning of this
   article and the techniques of fantasy involvement that have
   been empirically documented in the studies reported herein
   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-
   tional challenge of the current findings, then, remains appar-
   ent: How can the sorts of strategies illustrated in this article
   best be used to make learning simultaneously more enjoyable
   and more effective?

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   The present study explores research trends in fantasy by conducting a
   bibliometric analysis of literature indexed in the Scopus database. The
   PRISMA framework was employed to identify and select articles from the
   Scopus database. A search of the Scopus database using the term
   "fantasy" resulted in 7,177 documents from which 502 articles were
   shortlisted based on inclusion-exclusion criteria and manual screening.
   The selected metadata were exported in CSV format and analyzed using
   the R package Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software for bibliometric
   analysis and visualization. The study identifies the most influential
   authors, articles, journals, countries, keywords, and trends in
   publication over the years. The most cited document was "Brexit
   Populism and Fantasies of Fulfilment" by Browning, C.S. (2023) with 88
   citations, while Personality and Social Psychology emerged as the most
   influential source with 76 citations. Results show that although the
   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

   Participants in this study were asked to report what strategies were
   most often used in their attempts to foster their students’ problem
   solving abilities. Participants included 70 second through fifth-grade
   elementary teachers from 42 schools in a large state of the south
   central region in the US. Data analyses of the interviews revealed that
   none of the educators utilized all problem solving strategies
   recommended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Further
   examination of the interviews indicated that having their students draw
   a picture and identify key information was the teachers’ most taught
   word problem strategy. Here, we provide insight of the reported
   teachers’ strategies and the need for more explicit instruction of
   problem solving strategies when educating mathematics teachers.

   A case study of Divan poetry
   Thesis

   It is expected that this research will create a new perspective in
   introducing, conveying, and instilling aesthetic appreciation for the
   form and content characteristics of divan poetry to students. This aim
   is expected to be realized through learning environments where material
   examples developed with an interdisciplinary approach serve in the
   teaching of Divan poetry in Turkish language and literature. In the
   research, using an interdisciplinary approach, example materials were
   created by relating divan poetry texts from Turkish literature—suitable
   for the secondary education level—to other relevant disciplines. It is
   thought that the created materials will serve as an example for future
   materials to be supported by appropriate teaching methods and
   techniques. In the learning environments served by the material
   examples prepared with an interdisciplinary approach, it is expected
   that students will not feel limited by the thinking patterns of a
   specific discipline and will subsequently see information and
   experiences from different disciplines within certain concepts,
   thereby: • gaining critical and creative thinking skills, • developing
   problem-solving and independent decision-making abilities, • achieving
   easier, more permanent, meaningful, willing, confident, and efficient
   learning, • gaining an interdisciplinary perspective to achieve the
   goals of the environment or overcome encountered problems, • realizing
   the expected learning objectives at the end of the learning and
   teaching process. The research is qualitative and employs a descriptive
   survey model. To achieve the aims and sub-aims of the research,
   relevant publications and studies were reviewed, and the obtained data
   were analyzed using a descriptive and interpretative technique. With
   the obtained data, materials were prepared for the Turkish language and
   literature course on divan poetry using an interdisciplinary approach.
   With these materials, it is aimed to arouse interest in divan
   literature among today's students, to introduce them to the richness of
   genres and forms in divan literature, the subtle imagination,
   linguistic skill, and intellectual horizon, to make them aware of the
   traditional expression forms, and the richness of topics and content,
   and to enable students with a tendency towards literary taste in this
   direction to discover themselves. The study, which includes theoretical
   information, designed materials, and the stages and interpretations of
   the process of implementing these materials, also contains suggestions
   for relevant researchers and educators to serve as examples for similar
   studies. It is planned for the study to be transformed into an
   experimental study in the future.

   Following the global COVID-19 pandemic, digital learning environments
   have gained in importance in education all around the world. A new
   digital learning format called a “Digital Learning Module” (DLM) was
   developed within the Physics Education Research (PER) group at CERN,
   consisting of a series of prerecorded explanatory and experiment
   videos, interactive elements, an interactive simulation experiment, and
   expert interviews. So far, one DLM has been created on the topic of
   positron emission tomography (PET). Aiming to establish a set of
   effective design principles that can be employed in the design of
   future DLMs or similar digital learning environments, the goal of this
   research is to evaluate the already existing PET DLM. In doing so, this
   research brings together different theoretical and empirical studies,
   in order to identify design principles fitting the format of the DLM.
   It also reviews key physics literature on PET to identify its
   disciplinary-relevant aspects. First, an analysis of the PET DLM was
   performed in terms of the identified design principles and
   disciplinary-relevant aspects. Then, nine semistructured interviews
   were conducted with high-school students from Greece and Austria as
   they worked through the PET DLM. A qualitative content analysis of the
   interview transcripts has determined the set of effective design
   principles that will constitute the foundation of future DLMs developed
   by the CERN PER group and can serve as a starting point and reference
   for researchers developing similar digital learning environments
   elsewhere. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

     * Cheryl Taitague

   There is intense interest in computer games. A total of 65 percent of
   all American households play computer games, and sales of such games
   increased 22.9 percent last year. The average amount of game playing
   time was found to be 13.2 hours per week. The popularity and market
   success of games is evident from both the increased earnings from
   games, over $7 Billion in 2005, and from the fact that over 200
   academic institutions worldwide now offer game related programs of
   study.In view of the intense interest in computer games educators and
   trainers, in business, industry, the government, and the military would
   like to use computer games to improve the delivery of instruction.
   Computer Games and Instruction is intended for these educators and
   trainers. It reviews the research evidence supporting use of computer
   games, for instruction, and also reviews the history of games in
   general, in education, and by the military. In addition chapters
   examine gender differences in game use, and the implications of games
   for use by lower socio-economic students, for students’ reading, and
   for contemporary theories of instruction. Finally, well known scholars
   of games will respond to the evidence reviewed.

   This study introduces a novel design approach to game-based learning by
   integrating ChatGPT into the development of non-player characters
   (NPCs) within storylines. This integration seeks to enhance
   interactivity with student players and foster an immersive, dynamic
   learning environment. We applied this approach in English as a Foreign
   Language (EFL) writing classrooms to examine its impact on both the
   affective and cognitive aspects of student writing learning, as well as
   their writing performance. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the
   study involved two classes of Chinese undergraduate students. One class
   (n = 42) engaged with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, while the other class (n =
   43) interacted with conventional NPCs in a storyline-based game
   designed to enhance argumentative writing skills. Quantitative data
   were collected through questionnaires assessing students’ intrinsic
   motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort
   regulation. Additionally, student essays were evaluated to compare
   writing performance across the two conditions. Qualitative data,
   including students’ chat histories with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, were
   gathered to investigate their interactions. The results indicated that
   engaging with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs positively influenced students’
   intrinsic motivation and situational interest, leading them to invest
   greater effort in completing learning tasks. Notably, interactions with
   ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs did not increase students’ cognitive load during
   the learning process. Moreover, students who interacted with
   ChatGPT-powered NPCs exhibited superior writing performance, producing
   essays that were significantly clearer, more elaborated, and more
   persuasive, while also more effectively addressing opposing viewpoints.
   Additionally, students employed various conversational strategies while
   interacting with these NPCs. This study not only advances our
   understanding of the role of generative artificial intelligence in
   educational contexts but also provides valuable insights for educators
   seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes through
   innovative instructional strategies.

   Achievement attributions and self-instructions under competitive and
   individualistic goal structures
   Article
   Full-text available
     * Jun 1984

     * Carole Ames Carole Ames

   Investigated whether competitive and individualistic goal structures
   elicit achievement cognitions that have been associated with helpless
   vs mastery-oriented children, respectively. 88 5th- and 6th-grade
   children were administered a novel achievement task in which a high vs
   low performance outcome was manipulated by varying the number of
   solvable puzzles across 2 sets of 6 puzzles, within either a
   competitive or individual goal structure. A "thought-matching"
   methodology was used to assess the type of frequency of Ss' thoughts.
   Results revealed that Ss made more ability attributions in the
   competitive than in the individual condition. In the individual
   condition, Ss displayed a mastery orientation in that they made more
   effort attributions and engaged in self-instructions and
   self-monitoring more than did Ss in the competitive condition. Ability
   attributions were predictive of Ss' positive and negative affective
   reactions. Results suggest that Ss were thinking about responses to the
   question "Was I smart?" in the competitive setting but were thinking
   about "How can I do this task?" in the individual setting. It is
   suggested that getting children to think about how to improve their
   performance may not be compatible with the focus of attention in
   competitive situations. (29 ref)

   This study describes a scale for assessing children's beliefs that
   they, rather than other people, are responsible for their
   intellectual-academic successes and failures. Subscale scores assessing
   responsibility for successes and for failures were generally
   independent of each other. Split-half and test-retest reliabilities
   were moderately high. Normative data on 923 Ss in grades 3-12 indicate
   that self-responsibility is already established by third grade, that
   older girls give more self-responsible answers than older boys, and
   that slight but significant age changes occur in subscale scores
   dependent upon the sex of the child. Responsibility scores were
   moderately related to intelligence, ordinal position, and size of
   family, and inconsistently related to social class. Evidence of
   prediction to intellectual-achievement performance is presented.

   Cognition in Practice
   Book
     * Jul 1988

     * Jean Lave Jean Lave

   Most previous research on human cognition has focused on
   problem-solving, and has confined its investigations to the laboratory.
   As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental
   processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling -
   indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one
   particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving -
   out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing,
   she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is
   shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and
   its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human
   subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on
   mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in
   the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method,
   fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in
   its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of
   conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent
   social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of
   culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result
   is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of
   cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in
   which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to
   anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to
   culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists;
   and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize
   themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   Ask a group of college students to describe their most memo-
   rable and significant learning experiences in their elementary-
   school years and one discovers some interesting recollections.
   One student may remember the third-grade classroom in which
   the teacher played the role of a "crooked" shopkeeper, cajoling
   delighted students to add, subtract, multiply, and divide accu-
   rately, lest they find themselves short-changed on their pur-
   chases. Another may recall the history teacher who had stu-
   dents prepare a Renaissance banquet, complete with appro-
   priate food, music, costumes, and entertainment. Still another
   may speak of the social studies class in which the students held
   their own Constitutional Convention.
   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   conviction that such procedures may not only make education
   more enjoyable but may also enhance studentsʼ learning—that
   children learn best, most effectively and most lastingly, when
   they are intrinsically motivated to learn. If
   so,
   then increasing
   the motivational appeal of an educational activity should in-
   deed increase learning as well.
   Such a general relationship has been postulated by a number
   of theorists (e.g., Bruner, 1961; Condry, 1977; Deci, 1975; Lep-
   per & Greene,
   1978;
   Singer, 1973,1977), but there is little experi-
   mental evidence to support this contention (Lepper & Hodell,
   1989).
   To be sure, correlational studies in several areas have
   shown significant positive relationships between how interest-
   ing children say they find particular educational materials and
   how much they learn and recall from those materials (e.g.,
   Asher, 1979,1980; Asher & Markell, 1974; see also Anderson,
   Shirey, Wilson, & Fielding, 1987), but these studies contain no
   evidence to establish that the interest value of the material was
   a determinant, and not a consequence, of learning.1
   Of course, this lack of relevant experimental evidence may
   reflect, in part, the difficulty of varying the motivational ap-
   peal of an educational activity without varying other instruc-
   tional features of that activity as well. That is, many of the
   modifications that one could make to enhance the degree of
   challenge or the amount of curiosity a particular educational
   activity might produce would simultaneously alter the essential
   nature of the exercises or the instruction provided. Likewise,
   1 Moreover, these positive correlations may be a simple function of
   increased time spent on more interesting materials. For
   example,
   in at
   least one major survey in which the use of more highly motivating
   educational activities was not confounded with increased time spent
   on the topic
   itself,
   a significant negative relationship was found be-
   tween the reported
   use
   of such activities and measured student achieve-
   ment (Baker, Herman, & Yeh, 1981).

   demonstrations of the detrimental effects of extrinsic rewards
   (e.g., Lepper, 1988), competition (e.g., Ames, 1984), or a perfor-
   mance focus
   (e.g.,
   Dweck, 1986) on motivation and learning do
   not necessarily prove that increases in the motivational appeal
   of an activity will have corresponding positive effects on learn-
   ing. In each case, it would be difficult to determine whether
   subsequent differences in learning were the result of increases
   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone
   (1987),
   for
   example,
   have
   elaborated several mechanisms whereby enhanced interest in
   an educational activity may lead to increased learning from
   that activity—mechanisms that may be summarized as focus-
   ing the learnerʼs attention on relevant learning opportunities
   and increasing depth of involvement with, and investment of
   mental effort in, the educational aspects of the activity (cf.
   Condry, 1977; Corno & Mandinach, 1983; Salomon, 1983).
   Such beneficial effects on learning are predicted to occur, how-
   ever, only when the motivational embellishments reinforce and
   support the instructional goals of the activity. This should
   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
   ment that can be added without necessitating changes in the
   basic instructional content of
   the
   activities. Thus, this particu-
   lar strategy for enhancing student interest permits one to com-
   pare the effects of different versions of
   a
   common educational
   activity, holding constant the problems presented, the instruc-
   tion given, the feedback provided, and so forth. Hence, this
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
   strategy
   also
   permits an exami-
   nation of the potential effects on learning of motivational indi-
   vidualization of an educational activity.3
   In this article, we report two studies derived from this basic
   analysis. In each, we compared the effects of four versions of a
   series of computer-based educational activities designed to
   teach children
   basic
   graphics programming in Logo—a pro-
   gramming language designed, in part, to promote planning,
   problem solving, and mathematical skills in young children
   (e.g., Papert, 1980; Papert, Watt, diSessa, & Weir, 1979). In a
   basal, unembellished version of these activities, a progression
   of problems was presented in abstract form, involving simple
   line drawings and geometric
   shapes.
   In the other
   three
   versions,
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-
   mediate learning was assessed by traditional paper-and-pencil
   exams administered the day after the completion of these les-
   sons;
   retention of
   the
   material was assessed 2 weeks later.
   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach
   children the use of
   basic
   graphics commands in the program-
   ming language Logo were created. All four versions involved an
   identical series of lessons asking children to perform various
   graphics programming tasks. In the basal version of the pro-
   gram, these activities were presented in the form of straightfor-
   ward geometric problems (e.g., how to navigate oneʼs way
   through a maze); in the other three
   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each
   2 Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide examples of the
   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present
   cases,
   these
   two
   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.
   3 Although some common motivational benefits of fantasy involve-
   ment have been observed, differences in the specific fantasies that
   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound
   (e.g., Malone
   &
   Lepper,
   1987;
   Singer, 1973,1977).

   MAKING LEARNING MORE FUN

   series of programs and were asked first to rank order these
   programs and later to select one set of programs for their
   own use.
   Method
   Participants
   The sample included 24 male and 23 female third- and fourth-grade
   students from three parochial schools (two Catholic and one Episco-
   pal)
   in the San
   Francisco
   Bay
   Area
   of
   California. These children
   ranged in age from
   8
   to
   10
   years (M= 8.81, SD
   = .54)
   and came from a
   broad range
   of
   socioeconomic backgrounds. They participated,
   in
   small groups of 2 or 3,
   in
   two experimental sessions each.
   Instructional Programs
   The four sets of computer-based instructional programs all involved
   a series
   of
   formally identical activities requiring the student to make
   use
   of
   basic graphics commands
   in
   Logo. These activities required
   children to learn (a) how to draw lines connecting various collections
   of objects on the screen, (b) how to negotiate a passage through a
   series
   of mazes displayed on the screen, and
   (c)
   how to construct
   a
   prescribed
   series of simple geometric shapes on the screen.
   In
   the basal, no-fan-
   tasy version
   of
   this activity, each
   of
   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or
   herself as a pirate in search of buried treasure. In another, the child
   was
   placed
   in
   the role
   of
   a detective hunting down criminals;
   in
   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would
   be asked to "go meet the other astronauts and bring them back to the
   ship"
   displayed in the center of the screen. Similarly, in a next activity
   in which students
   in
   the no-fantasy version were asked
   to
   connect
   a
   series of circles with a single line, student-astronauts would be asked
   to
   explore
   a
   series of
   planets.
   Parallel embellishments
   in
   the other cases
   featured stories
   and
   illustrations involving pirates
   or
   detectives.
   A
   more detailed description of the precise series of lessons is included
   in
   the description of Study 2.
   Procedure
   Session 1. During
   the
   initial session, children were first given
   a
   30-min introduction
   to
   the Logo graphics commands they would
   be
   asked
   to
   work with. Following this lesson, the children were given
   a
   brief demonstration that provided highlights from each of the four sets
   of instructional activities. Order
   of
   presentation
   of
   the four versions
   was counterbalanced so that each version appeared equally often
   in
   each of the four positions in the demonstration. Each
   was
   presented
   for
   an approximately equal amount of time.
   After viewing the demonstration, undergraduate research assistants
   interviewed the children individually and asked the following:
   Of the four computer games you saw: (1) Which one would you
   most like to play? Which one do you like the best?
   (2)
   Which one
   would you like second best? (3) Which one would you like third
   best? and (4) Which one would you like the least?
   This interview provided
   us
   with
   a
   self-report measure
   of
   childrenʼs
   relative preferences for the four versions of the learning activities.
   Session
   2.
   Two
   days after the initial session, children were recruited
   for a second session. In this session, children were given a consequen-
   tial choice
   of
   activities.
   In
   particular, the children were asked, "Re-
   member the games you played last time? Which one would you like to
   play today?" Their choices were recorded and served as
   a
   behavioral
   measure of intrinsic motivation. Children were allowed to work on the
   computer, with the activity of their choice, for approximately 40 min.
   Results
   The results of Study
   1
   confirm the anticipated motivational
   benefits of embedding identical instructional activities in fan-
   tasy
   contexts.
   Even the simple embellishments used in the pres-
   ent study seemed to produce significant effects on childrenʼs
   stated preferences for the different learning
   activities.
   As
   shown
   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-
   sions of the learning activity were significantly higher than the
   mean ranking of the no-fantasy version,
   t(46) =
   7.80, p <
   .001;
   t(46) =
   6.99, p <
   .001;
   and /(46) = 3.92, p <
   .001,
   for compari-
   sons of the no-fantasy version with the
   detective,
   the pirate, and
   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,
   and 27.6% chose the pirate, detective, and space ver-
   sions,
   respectively, x2
   (3,
   N = 47) = 9.43, p < .05. As might be
   expected, childrenʼs stated preferences in the first session
   proved highly correlated with their choices in the second ses-
   sion. Only 4 students chose an activity that they had not previ-
   ously rated as their top choice.
   Finally, on neither measure were there any preference differ-
   ences between boys and
   girls;
   both showed the same preference
   for the fantasy versions of the activity. In addition, on neither
   measure did there appear to be any dramatic differences in the
   appeal of the various fantasy versions of the learning activities.
   Instead, childrenʼs specific fantasy preferences seemed nearly

   evenly spread across the three fantasies, thus setting the stage
   for our second study.
   Study 2: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Learning
   What difference, then, does it make if learning is more fun?
   Will children given equal exposure to different versions of
   identical instructional activities show different levels of learn-
   ing as a function of the motivational appeal of those activities?
   In view of the demonstrated increases in interest produced in
   Study
   1
   by the addition of simple fantasy embellishments, in
   Study 2, we examined the consequences for learning of these
   differences in motivational appeal, controlling for the time
   spent with the learning activities.
   Thus,
   Study 2 examined the effects on childrenʼs learning of
   embedding identical instructional materials in the various fan-
   tasy contexts examined in Study 1. In this second experiment,
   third-grade children worked, during four successive training
   sessions, with graphics commands from the Logo program-
   ming language, under one of three conditions. In a no-fantasy
   control condition, students were given a series of abstract prob-
   lems to solve during four instructional sessions. In two fantasy
   conditions, the identical problems were presented within a fan-
   tasy problem-solving context. In one of these groups, children
   were given their choice of three alternative fantasy contexts; in
   the other, children were assigned specific fantasies yoked to the
   choices of the other group. Children were tested, before and
   after exposure to these treatments, on their knowledge of Logo
   and of several underlying geometric concepts, providing an as-
   sessment of their learning from these different programs. Their
   retention of the material was examined 2 weeks later.
   Method
   Participants
   The sample included
   19
   male
   and
   13 female third-grade students
   from
   a
   private Catholic elementary school
   in the
   San Francisco Bay
   Area of California. These
   32
   children were randomly assigned, within
   sex,
   to
   one of three
   conditions:
   individualized
   fantasy,
   assigned fantasy,
   and no
   fantasy.
   Five children
   did not
   complete all seven sessions,
   so
   their data were
   not
   included.
   In the
   final sample, there were 10 chil-
   dren
   in the
   individualized-fantasy condition
   (6
   boys
   and 4
   girls),
   10
   children
   in
   the assigned-fantasy condition (5 boys and 5 girls),
   and 7
   children
   in the
   no-fantasy condition
   (5
   boys
   and 2
   girls). These
   27
   children in the
   final
   sample ranged in
   age
   from
   8
   to
   10 years
   (M= 8.77,
   SD
   =
   0.65) and came from predominantly lower-middle-income back-
   grounds,
   as
   estimated from parental occupations. None
   of
   the chil-
   dren, according to their parents,
   had
   prior programming experience.
   Experimenters
   The experimenters were six undergraduate psychology majors who
   administered
   all the
   lessons
   and
   assisted with pre-
   and
   posttesting.
   These experimenters first spent
   2 to 3
   hours learning Logoʼs basic
   commands.
   In
   addition, they spent approximately 6 hours practicing
   administering the lessons to each other, Louise Parker, and two pilot
   subjects. Louise Parker was also present
   at
   the school and assisted,
   if
   needed, with
   all
   pre-
   and posttests and with lesson administration.
   Procedure
   Session
   1:
   Pretest.
   The
   first
   session was devoted to pretesting. Prior
   to testing, all children were told that the experimenter
   was
   interested
   in how children learn with computers,
   and
   every effort was made
   to
   minimize perceptions of evaluative pressure. This was done by enlist-
   ing the children as our "assistants"
   in
   helping us to find out how well
   our new computer activities worked. Children were then pretested on
   their knowledge of basic geometric concepts underlying simple graph-
   ics programming in Logo
   (e.g.,
   estimation of line length and angle size
   and ability
   to
   follow directions), using
   a
   test that was based on mea-
   sures developed by Papert etal. (1979) and Milojkovic
   (1983/1984).
   In
   addition
   to
   these pretest measures, composite national percentile
   scores on a standardized school achievement measure, the California
   Test
   of
   Basic
   Skills, (CTBS), were available for all students.
   Children also filled
   out
   several pretest measures
   of
   their general
   academic motivation, including abbreviated versions
   of
   Harterʼs
   In-
   trinsic Motivation (1981)
   and
   Perceived Competence (1982) Scales,
   and they completed additional items measuring their self-rated enjoy-
   ment
   of,
   and self-perceived competence in, academic subjects. Scales
   of test anxiety (Sarason, Lighthall, Davidson,
   Waite,
   &
   Ruebush, 1960)
   and locus
   of
   control
   for
   academic achievement outcomes (Crandall,
   Katovsky, & Crandall, 1965) were also administered. All instructions
   and questions
   for
   these measures were read aloud,
   and the
   experi-
   menters assisted children
   who
   were having difficulty following
   in-
   structions. Total testing time was approximately 30 min.
   These affective and motivational pretest measures were included
   to
   examine the possibility that our experimental effects might differ
   as
   a
   function
   of
   prior differences
   in
   childrenʼs motivational orientations.
   Using median splits
   for
   each
   of
   these measures, however,
   the
   data
   revealed
   no
   significant interactions of these prior motivational orienta-
   tions with experimental conditions. Hence, these measures
   are not
   discussed further.
   Sessions
   2
   through
   5: The
   lessons.
   In
   the second through
   fifth
   ses-
   sions,
   children received instruction
   in the
   elementary concepts
   in-
   volved in using Logo turtle graphics (Papert,
   1980;
   Papert et
   al.,
   1979)
   and were asked
   to
   complete
   a
   graded progression
   of
   exercises using
   what they had been taught. Children participated, in groups of
   5
   or 6,
   in experimental sessions on
   4
   consecutive
   days.
   During these sessions,
   each child worked
   at a
   separate Apple 11+ computer,
   and
   each child
   was assigned
   an
   experimenter who
   sat
   with that child
   and
   provided
   assistance if needed.
   During Session
   2,
   all children were given a common introduction
   to
   the commands that they could use
   to
   move the cursor forward, back-
   ward, left, and right to make line drawings on the
   screen.
   The children
   were also taught commands that sent the cursor
   "home"
   to the middle
   of the screen and that erased the screen entirely. This lesson
   proceeded
   slowly and lasted approximately
   30
   min.
   At the end of the instructional
   period,
   a
   test was administered
   to
   ensure that all children
   had
   mas-
   tered these basic
   commands.
   All children
   were
   successful. During this
   first lesson, the experimenters remained blind to experimental condi-
   tion. At the end of the session, the experimenters opened sealed enve-
   lopes containing childrenʼs assignments to conditions.
   At this point, the treatment of children began to differ
   by
   condition.
   Children assigned to the individualized-fantasy condition were inter-
   viewed individually and told the following:
   When you come back next time, you can play one of these com-
   puter
   activities.
   Listen carefully
   so
   that you can pick which one of
   these activities you want to do when we meet next
   time.
   \bu
   will
   be doing the same activity on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
   afternoon.
   So,
   think carefully about which activity you would like
   to do the most.
   The experimenters then showed and read the following list of choices
   to the children: (1) Pirate Treasure Hunt (in this activity, pirates
   travel

   MAKING LEARNING MORE FUN629
   around and hunt for
   treasure),
   (2)
   Mission
   Space
   Search
   (in
   this activity,
   astronauts
   fly
   around and look for new
   planets),
   and
   (3)
   Clue Detective
   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.
   For students in these
   groups, for
   instance,
   mazes became
   catacombs,
   secret
   passages,
   or city
   streets.
   Overall, the differences between the fantasy and no-fantasy lessons
   were
   quite
   subtle.
   Three stories that corresponded
   to
   the three fantasies
   —pirates, space, and detectives—and that used the exercises as plot
   devices were written. Following a sentence or two introducing each
   fantasy, these stories differed only in the substitution of phrases
   (e.g.,
   "land on each planet" vs. "touch each circle"). The stories continued
   over the course of the
   lessons
   and
   were
   simply illustrated. For example,
   in the pirates story, the circles in the first exercise were replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of
   pirates.
   At the center of the screen was a line
   drawing of a pirate
   ship.
   Instead of being asked simply to connect the
   circles to the central point, children were asked to "go meet the other
   pirates and bring them back to the
   ship."
   Similarly, in a later connect-
   the-circles game, computer-drawn treasure islands that the children
   were asked to visit and plunder replaced the
   circles.
   Subsequently, one
   of the mazes was said to represent a winding tunnel and the other the
   inside of an evil wizardʼs treasure-laden castle. At the end of a final
   lesson, the pirates discovered that their ship had been wrecked, and
   the shape commands were offered as a more efficient means of "re-
   building" or redrawing the
   ship.
   The other fantasies used the exercises
   in a similar manner
   (e.g.,
   circles were replaced by planets and a rocket
   ship in the space story). In addition, in each of these cases, the
   cursor
   was given a name and served as the protagonist of the fantasy.
   More specifically, in Session 3, children were presented with three
   structured
   exercises.
   In the
   first,
   five
   Gircles
   appeared in
   a
   semicircle in
   the upper half of the screen, and students were instructed to connect
   the circles. In the second, children were asked to connect six circles
   placed in a full circle covering both halves of the screen. In the
   third,
   children were asked to navigate a maze by giving directions to the
   cursor. The maze was designed such that children could not take
   "short cuts" through the walls. If they attempted to do so or did so by
   accident, they would "bounce"
   back.
   Finally,
   children
   were
   given some
   time during which they could practice the commands they had learned
   by making up their own game until the end of the
   session.
   This lesson
   took approximately 40 min.4
   During Session
   4,
   the children
   were
   asked to navigate
   a
   second maze
   and to draw various geometric shapes. They were then given circular
   stickers of several colors which they could place on the screen to en-
   hance their drawings. In the no-fantasy condition, all of the stickers
   that the children received were unadorned; in the fantasy
   conditions,
   a
   few of the stickers had been embellished with simple icons relevant to
   the fantasy
   (e.g.,
   a treasure chest or
   a
   deserted
   island).
   It
   was
   hoped that
   the use of stickers would make the play more involving. At the end of
   this lesson there
   was
   a free-drawing period. This lesson took approxi-
   mately 40 min.
   Finally, in Session 5, the children were given more practice with
   drawing shapes. They were also taught several special shape com-
   mands that are not an inherent part of the Logo programming lan-
   guage but that were created specifically for this experiment. At the
   end
   of this last instructional session, there was again a brief period of
   unstructured activity. This last lesson took approximately 30 min.
   Sessions 6 and
   7:
   Posttesting.
   During Session 6, held on the day
   immediately after the last lesson, children were tested on their knowl-
   edge of
   Logo
   turtle graphics. The Logo Turtle Graphics Test (LTGT)
   developed for this purpose involved eight programming problems de-
   signed to assess childrenʼs understanding of, and ability to use, all
   the
   Logo procedures they had been taught. Half of these items asked stu-
   dents to give the commands necessary to produce a given picture; the
   other half asked students to draw the picture that would be produced
   by a given series of
   commands.
   This test constituted our measure of
   direct learning. The more abstract Geometric Concepts Test (GCT)
   was also readministered, to test for generalized learning.
   In addition to these learning measures, several additional attitu-
   dinal measures were administered. Children in all conditions were
   asked to answer, using 11 -point Likert scales (from
   0 = not at
   all to
   10
   =
   very very
   much),
   how much would they like to take another computer
   class,
   how much they liked the computer games they had played, and
   how much they liked working with the computer. For children in the
   two fantasy conditions, an additional question asked how much they
   liked the story that went with the computer games. Finally, two addi-
   tional questions asked for relative evaluations of how the computer
   activity compared with childrenʼs favorite board games and with their
   favorite subjects in school. On both of these last items, children were
   asked to indicate if the computer activity was
   (1)
   a
   lot more
   fun, (2) a
   little more
   fun, (3)
   as much
   fun,
   (4)
   almost as
   much
   fun, (5) a
   little less
   fun,
   or
   (6)
   a
   lot less
   fun.
   During Session 7, which took place 2 weeks after the last lesson,
   both the GCT and the LTGT were administered a final time. Thus,
   both immediate and delayed posttests of learning were obtained. The
   maximum score on the GCT was 43. The maximum score on the
   LTGT was 24. In addition, during this last session, one set of self-re-
   port measures initially included in the pretest battery was readminis-
   tered. Thus, students were asked to report on their liking for, and
   their
   perceived competence at, school mathematics and school in general.
   Results
   Preliminary Analyses
   Initial analyses were performed to determine whether there
   were interactions between experimental condition and either
   studentsʼ gender or their general academic achievement
   (as
   as-
   sessed by their CTBS
   scores).
   In neither analysis was there any
   evidence of an interaction of these variables with experimental
   condition. Therefore, the data were collapsed across both
   gender and initial achievement scores. As expected, however,
   CTBS scores did prove correlated with each of our cognitive
   pre-
   and posttest measures. As a result, these scores were em-
   ployed as a covariate for analyses on those measures.
   4 Note that these short unstructured activity periods were
   fixed
   and
   of equivalent length for all students. Hence, they do not provide a
   measure of student choice or persistence that could serve as a further
   indicator of studentsʼ intrinsic motivation.

   In addition, preliminary analyses revealed no significant
   dif-
   ferences
   on any
   of the measures between students
   in
   the individ-
   ualized-fantasy
   and the
   assigned-fantasy conditions.
   For pur-
   poses
   of
   further analysis, then, these
   two
   groups were
   com-
   bined, providing
   a
   comparison between children
   in
   the fantasy
   versus
   the
   no-fantasy conditions.
   Specific Learning
   The most direct test of our hypotheses concerning the effects
   of fantasy contexts
   on
   learning involved
   a
   comparison
   of
   the
   performance
   of
   students working with
   and
   without
   a
   fantasy
   context
   on
   measures
   of
   their learning
   of
   the specific material
   they had been taught.
   In
   the present
   case,
   these questions were
   best addressed
   by the
   data from
   the
   LTGT.
   Immediate

   To
   examine
   the
   effects
   of
   fantasy context
   on
   childrenʼs understanding
   of, and
   ability
   to
   use,
   the
   material explicitly presented to them,
   a
   one-way analy-
   sis
   of covariance (ANCOVA) was computed on childrenʼs scores
   on
   the
   LTGT, using childrenʼs
   CTBS
   math
   scores as a
   covariate.

   in
   the fantasy conditions showed significantly more learning than

   no-fantasy condition,

   Retention
   of material. Given these significant effects
   on ini-
   tial learning,
   it
   is
   of
   interest
   to
   know how effectively this initial
   learning was retained
   2
   weeks later. Hence,
   a
   comparable one-
   way ANCOVA, again using CTBS math scores
   as a
   covariate,
   was done using studentsʼ subsequent retention
   of
   the material
   taught
   as the
   dependent measure.
   On the
   delayed Logo post-
   test, once again, children
   in the
   fantasy conditions performed
   better than those
   in the
   no-fantasy condition,
   F(l,

   =
   4.93,
   p <
   .05, as shown

   In addition
   to
   these measures
   of
   the
   specific material taught
   to students, both
   the

   posttests included measures
   of
   studentsʼ understanding

   Self-Report Measures
   Three clusters
   of
   self-report measures were also obtained
   at
   the
   end of
   the
   last session.
   A
   first
   pair
   of
   measures asked chil-
   dren directly how much they liked "the games they played" and
   "working with
   the
   computer."
   On
   these measures,
   a
   clear ceil-
   ing effect
   was
   obtained. Over 80%
   of all
   subjects responded
   with the top
   rating;
   means ranged from 9.30 to 9.42 and did not
   differ by condition.
   The last self-report measures, administered
   2
   weeks later,
   asked students to rate their liking for, and competence
   at,
   math-
   ematics
   and
   school
   in
   general.
   Using the
   pretest
   scores
   available
   on this measure as
   a
   covariate,
   the
   results more closely resem-
   bled
   our
   learning effects (M= 24.58
   for
   the fantasy conditions,
   and
   M
   =
   18.90 for the
   no-fantasy condition). However, these
   differences, although more pronounced, also
   did not
   achieve
   statistical significance,
   F(l,
   14)
   =
   2.52,
   p
   =
   .125.
   Finally,
   we
   examined studentsʼ records during
   the
   learning
   sessions
   for evidence of greater interest or involvement. Unfortu-
   nately
   our
   "automated" recording system broke down early,
   leaving us with limited data from only half our subjects
   (9
   in the
   fantasy condition
   and
   5
   in
   the no-fantasy condition). Nonethe-
   less,
   we did
   find evidence
   of our
   fantasy condition subjects
   proving more effective
   (M=
   4.44)
   in
   the central task of the first
   learning session (touching
   a
   series
   of
   circles)
   than
   our
   no-fan-
   tasy condition subjects
   (M=
   2.60),
   t{\2)
   =
   2.26,
   p
   <
   .05.
   That
   this finding
   may
   have been
   the
   result
   of
   a
   deeper involvement
   by the fantasy condition subjects
   is
   further suggested
   by
   the fact
   that all four
   of
   the
   students who succeeded
   at
   this task without
   misses
   or
   backtracking were
   in the
   fantasy conditions.

   MAKING LEARNING MORE FUN631
   General Discussion
   Taken together, the present results demonstrate that in-
   creased learning may occur when instructional materials are
   made more intrinsically motivating for students. In particular,
   these findings illustrate two important benefits of
   the
   instruc-
   tional strategy of embedding educational materials in appeal-
   ing fantasy contexts. First, the findings of Study
   1
   suggest that
   the addition of even relatively minimal fantasy embellishments
   can significantly enhance the motivational appeal of common
   educational activities for children. In situations in which chil-
   dren may be allowed to determine how much time they spend
   with different activities, such differences in interest may ulti-
   mately result in differences in learning, simply as a function of
   the amount of time children spend with the activity. At the
   same time, the results of Study 2 provide evidence of an even
   more profound effect on learning of embedding instructional
   materials in
   a
   fantasy
   context.
   Even when the time that students
   were allowed to spend at the activity
   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.
   Interestingly, these effects appeared equally strong, in the
   present
   studies,
   whether students
   were
   allowed
   to
   select
   an
   indi-
   vidualized fantasy or were assigned a fantasy independent of
   their particular preferences. In
   this
   context,
   however, it
   is
   worth
   noting that our
   sample
   of fantasies
   was small
   and that the fanta-
   sies we
   used
   were
   deliberately chosen
   to be
   of general applicabil-
   ity and appeal. Had the range of options included fantasies that
   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.
   Alternative Mechanisms
   Although we have concentrated on the manner in which the
   provision of a fantasy context
   may
   enhance learning
   by
   increas-
   ing the childʼs level of motivation, it is possible that there are
   also other, more purely cognitive, processes that may have con-
   tributed to the observed effects. Obviously, there
   is a
   large litera-
   ture attesting to the power of visual imagery
   (e.g.,
   Bower, 1972;
   Paivio, 1971), the importance of
   having
   a coherent perspective
   or point of view (e.g., Anderson & Pichert, 1978; Pichert &
   Anderson, 1977), and the significance of a concrete representa-
   tion of problems (e.g., Anderson, 1980; Schoenfeld, 1985) as
   determinants of recall in humans.
   However, the present studies would seem a priori to provide
   a setting in which one might least expect such effects to be
   important. First, there were few explicit memory demands in-
   volved in the learning tasks; indeed, the relevant commands
   remained posted during both the training session and the test-
   ing sessions. It was, instead, the procedural knowledge of
   how
   to use those basic commands efficiently that was at issue for
   these students. Second, as is the case with any use of Logo
   graphics, the task itself
   was
   inherently concrete and
   visual,
   even
   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as
   is
   also the case with nor-
   mal classes in Logo, students in the no-fantasy condition, as
   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to
   "take the point of
   view"
   of
   the
   cursor and to move themselves
   about as they had instructed the cursor to
   move,
   as
   a device for
   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
   1990; Rogoff
   &
   Lave, 1984). In this
   literature, a common finding is that people frequently perform
   tasks quite competently and successfully in concrete and highly
   familiar situations that they are unable to perform when those
   tasks are presented out of context, as on traditional paper-and-
   pencil tests of
   the
   material presented in school.
   In the present case, however, our significant learning results
   appear on measures involving precisely the sort of abstract and
   decontextualized paper-and-pencil tests on which, in
   the
   every-
   day cognition literature, one does not normally find effects.
   Coupled with our data showing
   some
   generalization of learning
   —on even more abstract and out-of-context tests administered
   2 weeks later—the present findings seem more contradictory
   to,
   then derivable from, the everyday cognition literature.
   Educational Implications
   Whatever the underlying mechanisms, the present findings
   have implications for the design of instructional materials and
   exercises for children. Certainly, the motivational and instruc-
   tional benefits observed are consistent with recent calls for the
   reemergence of a "project-centered" approach to curriculum
   design
   (e.g.,
   Katz
   &
   Chard, 1989), in which instructional objec-
   tives are
   integrated into meaningful long-term
   activities
   deliber-
   ately designed and selected for their potential to sustain high
   levels of intrinsic interest.
   Our findings also have the special relevance for the domain
   of computer-based education. In the current studies, the use of
   the computer
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,
   books, peers, television, or any other medium of learn-
   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay
   &
   Sherwood, in
   press;
   Dugdale & Kibbey, 1980; Snyder
   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
   1983;
   Greenfield,
   1984;
   Lepper, 1985).
   Whereas proponents have been quick to note the motivational
   advantages of such procedures (e.g., Lesgold, 1982; Loftus &
   Loftus,
   1983;
   Snyder
   &
   Palmer, 1986), opponents have viewed
   such attempts to "sugarcoat" instruction as ill-advised and
   likely to produce less lasting and less efficient learning (e.g.,

   DAttore,
   1981;
   Psotka,
   1982).
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
   be
   clear about the evident
   limitations of the present effects, because quite obviously the
   mere presentation of abstract problems in the form of
   a
   story
   will guarantee neither increased interest nor enhanced learn-
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
   the teaching of mathematics (e.g., Resnick & Ford, 1981;
   Schoenfeld, 1985). On the one hand, in the typical mathemati-
   cal word problem, the use of a story creates
   a
   dramatic increase
   in the difficulty of the studentsʼ task, because they must now
   translate the story into an equation before attempting to solve
   that equation. On the other hand, the stories used in these
   problems are also virtually devoid of interest value. There are
   no characters with whom students would identify, no meaning-
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;
   clearly, the most vocal proponents of project-centered curricula
   have focused on schooling in the elementary years. Whether
   there are fundamental differences in the processes involved or
   simply an increase in the complexity and richness required for
   a
   fantasy to
   be
   of interest to older students remains an interesting
   topic for future study.
   On the other hand, it is equally clear that the need for tech-
   niques to enhance student interest in traditional educational
   materials may actually increase with age. Young children, for
   example, seem continuously involved in learning; indeed, the
   idea of a preschooler displaying "motivational difficulties" in
   learning to walk, to talk, or to explore
   his
   or her environment is
   almost unthinkable. By contrast, as children progress through
   school "motivation" seems increasingly likely to be identified as
   "a problem." (Holt, 1964; Jackson, 1968; Lepper & Greene,
   1978;
   Silberman, 1970). In fact, explicit survey data obtained
   from school-age students display a continuing decrease in re-
   ported intrinsic motivation toward school work from grade
   three through grade nine (Harter, 1981).
   In part, such discouraging trends may be a consequence of
   the progressive "decontextualization" of learning that occurs as
   students move from grade to grade (Bruner, 1961, 1966;
   Condry, 1977). Both the sorts of projects commonly recalled in
   the reminiscences of students discussed in the beginning of this
   article and the techniques of fantasy involvement that have
   been empirically documented in the studies reported herein
   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-
   tional challenge of the current findings, then, remains appar-
   ent: How can the sorts of strategies illustrated in this article
   best be used to make learning simultaneously more enjoyable
   and more effective?

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

   The present study explores research trends in fantasy by conducting a
   bibliometric analysis of literature indexed in the Scopus database. The
   PRISMA framework was employed to identify and select articles from the
   Scopus database. A search of the Scopus database using the term
   "fantasy" resulted in 7,177 documents from which 502 articles were
   shortlisted based on inclusion-exclusion criteria and manual screening.
   The selected metadata were exported in CSV format and analyzed using
   the R package Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software for bibliometric
   analysis and visualization. The study identifies the most influential
   authors, articles, journals, countries, keywords, and trends in
   publication over the years. The most cited document was "Brexit
   Populism and Fantasies of Fulfilment" by Browning, C.S. (2023) with 88
   citations, while Personality and Social Psychology emerged as the most
   influential source with 76 citations. Results show that although the
   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

   Participants in this study were asked to report what strategies were
   most often used in their attempts to foster their students’ problem
   solving abilities. Participants included 70 second through fifth-grade
   elementary teachers from 42 schools in a large state of the south
   central region in the US. Data analyses of the interviews revealed that
   none of the educators utilized all problem solving strategies
   recommended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Further
   examination of the interviews indicated that having their students draw
   a picture and identify key information was the teachers’ most taught
   word problem strategy. Here, we provide insight of the reported
   teachers’ strategies and the need for more explicit instruction of
   problem solving strategies when educating mathematics teachers.

   It is expected that this research will create a new perspective in
   introducing, conveying, and instilling aesthetic appreciation for the
   form and content characteristics of divan poetry to students. This aim
   is expected to be realized through learning environments where material
   examples developed with an interdisciplinary approach serve in the
   teaching of Divan poetry in Turkish language and literature. In the
   research, using an interdisciplinary approach, example materials were
   created by relating divan poetry texts from Turkish literature—suitable
   for the secondary education level—to other relevant disciplines. It is
   thought that the created materials will serve as an example for future
   materials to be supported by appropriate teaching methods and
   techniques. In the learning environments served by the material
   examples prepared with an interdisciplinary approach, it is expected
   that students will not feel limited by the thinking patterns of a
   specific discipline and will subsequently see information and
   experiences from different disciplines within certain concepts,
   thereby: • gaining critical and creative thinking skills, • developing
   problem-solving and independent decision-making abilities, • achieving
   easier, more permanent, meaningful, willing, confident, and efficient
   learning, • gaining an interdisciplinary perspective to achieve the
   goals of the environment or overcome encountered problems, • realizing
   the expected learning objectives at the end of the learning and
   teaching process. The research is qualitative and employs a descriptive
   survey model. To achieve the aims and sub-aims of the research,
   relevant publications and studies were reviewed, and the obtained data
   were analyzed using a descriptive and interpretative technique. With
   the obtained data, materials were prepared for the Turkish language and
   literature course on divan poetry using an interdisciplinary approach.
   With these materials, it is aimed to arouse interest in divan
   literature among today's students, to introduce them to the richness of
   genres and forms in divan literature, the subtle imagination,
   linguistic skill, and intellectual horizon, to make them aware of the
   traditional expression forms, and the richness of topics and content,
   and to enable students with a tendency towards literary taste in this
   direction to discover themselves. The study, which includes theoretical
   information, designed materials, and the stages and interpretations of
   the process of implementing these materials, also contains suggestions
   for relevant researchers and educators to serve as examples for similar
   studies. It is planned for the study to be transformed into an
   experimental study in the future.

   Following the global COVID-19 pandemic, digital learning environments
   have gained in importance in education all around the world. A new
   digital learning format called a “Digital Learning Module” (DLM) was
   developed within the Physics Education Research (PER) group at CERN,
   consisting of a series of prerecorded explanatory and experiment
   videos, interactive elements, an interactive simulation experiment, and
   expert interviews. So far, one DLM has been created on the topic of
   positron emission tomography (PET). Aiming to establish a set of
   effective design principles that can be employed in the design of
   future DLMs or similar digital learning environments, the goal of this
   research is to evaluate the already existing PET DLM. In doing so, this
   research brings together different theoretical and empirical studies,
   in order to identify design principles fitting the format of the DLM.
   It also reviews key physics literature on PET to identify its
   disciplinary-relevant aspects. First, an analysis of the PET DLM was
   performed in terms of the identified design principles and
   disciplinary-relevant aspects. Then, nine semistructured interviews
   were conducted with high-school students from Greece and Austria as
   they worked through the PET DLM. A qualitative content analysis of the
   interview transcripts has determined the set of effective design
   principles that will constitute the foundation of future DLMs developed
   by the CERN PER group and can serve as a starting point and reference
   for researchers developing similar digital learning environments
   elsewhere. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

   There is intense interest in computer games. A total of 65 percent of
   all American households play computer games, and sales of such games
   increased 22.9 percent last year. The average amount of game playing
   time was found to be 13.2 hours per week. The popularity and market
   success of games is evident from both the increased earnings from
   games, over $7 Billion in 2005, and from the fact that over 200
   academic institutions worldwide now offer game related programs of
   study.In view of the intense interest in computer games educators and
   trainers, in business, industry, the government, and the military would
   like to use computer games to improve the delivery of instruction.
   Computer Games and Instruction is intended for these educators and
   trainers. It reviews the research evidence supporting use of computer
   games, for instruction, and also reviews the history of games in
   general, in education, and by the military. In addition chapters
   examine gender differences in game use, and the implications of games
   for use by lower socio-economic students, for students’ reading, and
   for contemporary theories of instruction. Finally, well known scholars
   of games will respond to the evidence reviewed.

   This study introduces a novel design approach to game-based learning by
   integrating ChatGPT into the development of non-player characters
   (NPCs) within storylines. This integration seeks to enhance
   interactivity with student players and foster an immersive, dynamic
   learning environment. We applied this approach in English as a Foreign
   Language (EFL) writing classrooms to examine its impact on both the
   affective and cognitive aspects of student writing learning, as well as
   their writing performance. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the
   study involved two classes of Chinese undergraduate students. One class
   (n = 42) engaged with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, while the other class (n =
   43) interacted with conventional NPCs in a storyline-based game
   designed to enhance argumentative writing skills. Quantitative data
   were collected through questionnaires assessing students’ intrinsic
   motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort
   regulation. Additionally, student essays were evaluated to compare
   writing performance across the two conditions. Qualitative data,
   including students’ chat histories with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, were
   gathered to investigate their interactions. The results indicated that
   engaging with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs positively influenced students’
   intrinsic motivation and situational interest, leading them to invest
   greater effort in completing learning tasks. Notably, interactions with
   ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs did not increase students’ cognitive load during
   the learning process. Moreover, students who interacted with
   ChatGPT-powered NPCs exhibited superior writing performance, producing
   essays that were significantly clearer, more elaborated, and more
   persuasive, while also more effectively addressing opposing viewpoints.
   Additionally, students employed various conversational strategies while
   interacting with these NPCs. This study not only advances our
   understanding of the role of generative artificial intelligence in
   educational contexts but also provides valuable insights for educators
   seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes through
   innovative instructional strategies.

   Achievement attributions and self-instructions under competitive and
   individualistic goal structures
   Article
   Full-text available
     * Jun 1984

     * Carole Ames Carole Ames

   Investigated whether competitive and individualistic goal structures
   elicit achievement cognitions that have been associated with helpless
   vs mastery-oriented children, respectively. 88 5th- and 6th-grade
   children were administered a novel achievement task in which a high vs
   low performance outcome was manipulated by varying the number of
   solvable puzzles across 2 sets of 6 puzzles, within either a
   competitive or individual goal structure. A "thought-matching"
   methodology was used to assess the type of frequency of Ss' thoughts.
   Results revealed that Ss made more ability attributions in the
   competitive than in the individual condition. In the individual
   condition, Ss displayed a mastery orientation in that they made more
   effort attributions and engaged in self-instructions and
   self-monitoring more than did Ss in the competitive condition. Ability
   attributions were predictive of Ss' positive and negative affective
   reactions. Results suggest that Ss were thinking about responses to the
   question "Was I smart?" in the competitive setting but were thinking
   about "How can I do this task?" in the individual setting. It is
   suggested that getting children to think about how to improve their
   performance may not be compatible with the focus of attention in
   competitive situations. (29 ref)

   This study describes a scale for assessing children's beliefs that
   they, rather than other people, are responsible for their
   intellectual-academic successes and failures. Subscale scores assessing
   responsibility for successes and for failures were generally
   independent of each other. Split-half and test-retest reliabilities
   were moderately high. Normative data on 923 Ss in grades 3-12 indicate
   that self-responsibility is already established by third grade, that
   older girls give more self-responsible answers than older boys, and
   that slight but significant age changes occur in subscale scores
   dependent upon the sex of the child. Responsibility scores were
   moderately related to intelligence, ordinal position, and size of
   family, and inconsistently related to social class. Evidence of
   prediction to intellectual-achievement performance is presented.

   Cognition in Practice
   Book
     * Jul 1988

     * Jean Lave Jean Lave

   Most previous research on human cognition has focused on
   problem-solving, and has confined its investigations to the laboratory.
   As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental
   processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling -
   indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one
   particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving -
   out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing,
   she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is
   shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and
   its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human
   subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on
   mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in
   the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method,
   fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in
   its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of
   conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent
   social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of
   culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result
   is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of
   cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in
   which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to
   anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to
   culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists;
   and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize
   themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.

Abstract

   Two studies examined the effects of embedding instructional materials
   in relevant fantasy contexts on children's motivation and learning. In
   Study 1, Ss showed marked preferences for computer-based educational
   programs that involved fantasy elements. In Study 2, Ss worked with
   these programs for 5 hr. One program presented purely abstract
   problems. Others presented identical problems within fantasy contexts.
   Some Ss chose among 3 fantasies; others were assigned identical
   fantasies. Tests on the material occurred before, immediately after,
   and 2 weeks after the experimental sessions. Ss showed significantly
   greater learning and transfer in the fantasy than in the no-fantasy
   conditions. Having a choice of fantasies made no difference.
   Motivational and individualization strategies for enhancing interest
   and promoting learning are discussed.

   Ask a group of college students to describe their most memo-
   rable and significant learning experiences in their elementary-
   school years and one discovers some interesting recollections.
   One student may remember the third-grade classroom in which
   the teacher played the role of a "crooked" shopkeeper, cajoling
   delighted students to add, subtract, multiply, and divide accu-
   rately, lest they find themselves short-changed on their pur-
   chases. Another may recall the history teacher who had stu-
   dents prepare a Renaissance banquet, complete with appro-
   priate food, music, costumes, and entertainment. Still another
   may speak of the social studies class in which the students held
   their own Constitutional Convention.
   For many years, master teachers have sought to create curric-
   ulum units to interest and to involve their students by embed-
   ding instructional materials and educational activities into ap-
   pealing fantasy contexts (Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Cha-
   bay, 1990). Underlying the use of such strategies is the common

   conviction that such procedures may not only make education
   more enjoyable but may also enhance studentsʼ learning—that
   children learn best, most effectively and most lastingly, when
   they are intrinsically motivated to learn. If
   so,
   then increasing
   the motivational appeal of an educational activity should in-
   deed increase learning as well.
   Such a general relationship has been postulated by a number
   of theorists (e.g., Bruner, 1961; Condry, 1977; Deci, 1975; Lep-
   per & Greene,
   1978;
   Singer, 1973,1977), but there is little experi-
   mental evidence to support this contention (Lepper & Hodell,
   1989).
   To be sure, correlational studies in several areas have
   shown significant positive relationships between how interest-
   ing children say they find particular educational materials and
   how much they learn and recall from those materials (e.g.,
   Asher, 1979,1980; Asher & Markell, 1974; see also Anderson,
   Shirey, Wilson, & Fielding, 1987), but these studies contain no
   evidence to establish that the interest value of the material was
   a determinant, and not a consequence, of learning.1
   Of course, this lack of relevant experimental evidence may
   reflect, in part, the difficulty of varying the motivational ap-
   peal of an educational activity without varying other instruc-
   tional features of that activity as well. That is, many of the
   modifications that one could make to enhance the degree of

   activity might produce would simultaneously alter the essential
   nature of the exercises or the instruction provided. Likewise,
   1 Moreover, these positive correlations may be a simple function of
   increased time spent on more interesting materials. For
   example,
   in at
   least one major survey in which the use of more highly motivating
   educational activities was not confounded with increased time spent
   on the topic
   itself,
   a significant negative relationship was found be-
   tween the reported
   use
   of such activities and measured student achieve-
   ment (Baker, Herman, & Yeh, 1981).

   demonstrations of the detrimental effects of extrinsic rewards
   (e.g., Lepper, 1988), competition (e.g., Ames, 1984), or a perfor-
   mance focus
   (e.g.,
   Dweck, 1986) on motivation and learning do
   not necessarily prove that increases in the motivational appeal
   of an activity will have corresponding positive effects on learn-
   ing. In each case, it would be difficult to determine whether
   subsequent differences in learning were the result of increases
   in motivation or of other factors.
   Recent analyses by Lepper and Malone (1987; Malone &
   Lepper, 1987), however, suggest one strategy—that of embed-
   ding educational activities in an appealing fantasy context—
   that theoretically should offer an effective means of enhancing
   studentʼs intrinsic motivation as well as a propitious laboratory
   in which to study the effects on learning of making educational
   activities more intrinsically motivating for
   students.
   First, there
   is already considerable evidence that involvement in fantasy is
   often highly intrinsically motivating (Fein,
   1981;
   Singer, 1977);
   indeed, Malone and Lepper (1987) have identified fantasy in-
   volvement as one of four primary sources of intrinsic motiva-
   tion.
   Second, the strategy of embedding educational problems
   and instruction in a fantasy context also provides the appro-
   priate conditions under which one would expect motivational
   embellishments of an educational activity to have positive ef-
   fects on learning. Lepper and Malone
   (1987),
   for
   example,
   have
   elaborated several mechanisms whereby enhanced interest in
   an educational activity may lead to increased learning from
   that activity—mechanisms that may be summarized as focus-
   ing the learnerʼs attention on relevant learning opportunities
   and increasing depth of involvement with, and investment of
   mental effort in, the educational aspects of the activity (cf.
   Condry, 1977; Corno & Mandinach, 1983; Salomon, 1983).
   Such beneficial effects on learning are predicted to occur, how-
   ever, only when the motivational embellishments reinforce and
   support the instructional goals of the activity. This should
   clearly be the situation when progressive involvement in, and
   enjoyment of,
   a
   fantasy can be made to depend on an increasing
   proficiency in the subject matter being presented, as in the
   cases discussed here.2
   Finally, the provision of a fantasy context for standard educa-
   tional activities also provides
   a
   form of motivational embellish-
   ment that can be added without necessitating changes in the
   basic instructional content of
   the
   activities. Thus, this particu-
   lar strategy for enhancing student interest permits one to com-
   pare the effects of different versions of
   a
   common educational
   activity, holding constant the problems presented, the instruc-
   tion given, the feedback provided, and so forth. Hence, this
   strategy affords the opportunity for examining more clearly
   how increases in the interest value of educational materials
   may influence learning from those materials. In similar fash-
   ion, because different fantasy contexts may be created for a
   single instructional
   activity,
   this
   strategy
   also
   permits an exami-
   nation of the potential effects on learning of motivational indi-
   vidualization of an educational activity.3
   In this article, we report two studies derived from this basic
   analysis. In each, we compared the effects of four versions of a
   series of computer-based educational activities designed to
   teach children
   basic
   graphics programming in Logo—a pro-
   gramming language designed, in part, to promote planning,
   problem solving, and mathematical skills in young children
   (e.g., Papert, 1980; Papert, Watt, diSessa, & Weir, 1979). In a
   basal, unembellished version of these activities, a progression
   of problems was presented in abstract form, involving simple
   line drawings and geometric
   shapes.
   In the other
   three
   versions,
   this same progression of problems—with identical rules govern-
   ing the presentation of problems, provision of information, de-
   livery of feedback, and the like—was presented within one or
   another fantasy context. In these cases, a brief story and a few
   simple icons were used to establish a context in which problem
   solutions would be seen as a means of fulfilling fantasied goals.
   In Study 1, we assessed the effects of this manipulation of
   fantasy context on studentsʼ interest in the activities. Children
   were shown all four sets of activities and were asked first to
   indicate their preferences among
   all
   four and later to select one
   version with which to work themselves. In Study 2, we then
   examined the effects of fantasy context on learning, controlling
   for the amount of time that students were asked to spend with
   the activity. Children spent
   five
   experimental sessions working
   with either the no-fantasy version of these activities, a fantasy
   version of these activities of their own choosing, or a fantasy
   version of
   these
   activities that had been assigned to them. Im-
   mediate learning was assessed by traditional paper-and-pencil
   exams administered the day after the completion of these les-
   sons;
   retention of
   the
   material was assessed 2 weeks later.
   Study 1: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Interest
   In our first study, then, we examined the effectiveness of one
   particular strategy for enhancing the motivational appeal of an
   educational activity, while holding constant its instructional
   features. The primary goal of Study
   1 was
   to determine whether
   a series of simple fantasy embellishments of an instructional
   computer activity would have significant effects on studentsʼ
   interest in, and subsequent choice of, that activity.
   To this end, four versions of a set of lessons designed to teach
   children the use of
   basic
   graphics commands in the program-
   ming language Logo were created. All four versions involved an
   identical series of lessons asking children to perform various
   graphics programming tasks. In the basal version of the pro-
   gram, these activities were presented in the form of straightfor-
   ward geometric problems (e.g., how to navigate oneʼs way
   through a maze); in the other three
   embellished
   versions,
   these
   same problems were embedded in a fantasy context involving
   stories relevant to the adventures of groups of pirates, detec-
   tives,
   or astronauts
   (e.g.,
   how to find oneʼs way through a series
   of secret passages). To assess the effects of these fantasy embel-
   lishments on the motivational appeal of these activities to chil-
   dren, all students were shown representative samples of each
   2 Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide examples of the
   use of fantasies in current, supposedly educational, computer pro-
   grams in which the goals of "learning the material" and "enjoying the
   fantasy or game" are at odds with one another and in which winning
   the game may supersede
   learning.
   In the present
   cases,
   these
   two
   goals
   have been designed to be congruent with one another.
   3 Although some common motivational benefits of fantasy involve-
   ment have been observed, differences in the specific fantasies that
   appeal to particular individuals are typically powerful and profound
   (e.g., Malone
   &
   Lepper,
   1987;
   Singer, 1973,1977).

   series of programs and were asked first to rank order these
   programs and later to select one set of programs for their
   own use.
   Method
   Participants
   The sample included 24 male and 23 female third- and fourth-grade
   students from three parochial schools (two Catholic and one Episco-
   pal)
   in the San
   Francisco
   Bay
   Area
   of
   California. These children
   ranged in age from
   8
   to
   10
   years (M= 8.81, SD
   = .54)
   and came from a
   broad range
   of
   socioeconomic backgrounds. They participated,
   in
   small groups of 2 or 3,
   in
   two experimental sessions each.
   Instructional Programs
   The four sets of computer-based instructional programs all involved
   a series
   of
   formally identical activities requiring the student to make
   use
   of
   basic graphics commands
   in
   Logo. These activities required
   children to learn (a) how to draw lines connecting various collections
   of objects on the screen, (b) how to negotiate a passage through a
   series
   of mazes displayed on the screen, and
   (c)
   how to construct
   a
   prescribed
   series of simple geometric shapes on the screen.
   In
   the basal, no-fan-
   tasy version
   of
   this activity, each
   of
   these activities involved simple
   abstract line drawings and geometric shapes, without any further em-
   bellishments.
   The three fantasy versions
   of
   these activities involved
   an
   identical
   series of problems, but these problems were presented in the context of
   simple stories that embedded problem solutions in one of three fantasy
   contexts. In one case, the student
   was
   encouraged to think of himself or
   herself as a pirate in search of buried treasure. In another, the child
   was
   placed
   in
   the role
   of
   a detective hunting down criminals;
   in
   still an-
   other, the student was asked to pretend to be an astronaut seeking out
   new planets in space. These brief stories were accompanied by appro-
   priate simple illustrations that supported the fantasy.
   For example,
   an
   initial activity
   in the
   no-fantasy lessons involved
   asking the students to draw lines connecting a circle at the center of
   the
   screen with a set of other circles displayed on the monitor. In a
   fantasy
   version of this activity, the circles on the screen would be replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of human faces and the student-astronauts would
   be asked to "go meet the other astronauts and bring them back to the
   ship"
   displayed in the center of the screen. Similarly, in a next activity
   in which students
   in
   the no-fantasy version were asked
   to
   connect
   a
   series of circles with a single line, student-astronauts would be asked
   to
   explore
   a
   series of
   planets.
   Parallel embellishments
   in
   the other cases
   featured stories
   and
   illustrations involving pirates
   or
   detectives.
   A
   more detailed description of the precise series of lessons is included
   in
   the description of Study 2.
   Procedure
   Session 1. During
   the
   initial session, children were first given
   a
   30-min introduction
   to
   the Logo graphics commands they would
   be
   asked
   to
   work with. Following this lesson, the children were given
   a
   brief demonstration that provided highlights from each of the four sets
   of instructional activities. Order
   of
   presentation
   of
   the four versions
   was counterbalanced so that each version appeared equally often
   in
   each of the four positions in the demonstration. Each
   was
   presented
   for
   an approximately equal amount of time.
   After viewing the demonstration, undergraduate research assistants
   interviewed the children individually and asked the following:
   Of the four computer games you saw: (1) Which one would you
   most like to play? Which one do you like the best?
   (2)
   Which one
   would you like second best? (3) Which one would you like third
   best? and (4) Which one would you like the least?
   This interview provided
   us
   with
   a
   self-report measure
   of
   childrenʼs
   relative preferences for the four versions of the learning activities.
   Session
   2.
   Two
   days after the initial session, children were recruited
   for a second session. In this session, children were given a consequen-
   tial choice
   of
   activities.
   In
   particular, the children were asked, "Re-
   member the games you played last time? Which one would you like to
   play today?" Their choices were recorded and served as
   a
   behavioral
   measure of intrinsic motivation. Children were allowed to work on the
   computer, with the activity of their choice, for approximately 40 min.
   Results
   The results of Study
   1
   confirm the anticipated motivational
   benefits of embedding identical instructional activities in fan-
   tasy
   contexts.
   Even the simple embellishments used in the pres-
   ent study seemed to produce significant effects on childrenʼs
   stated preferences for the different learning
   activities.
   As
   shown
   in Table 1, the mean rankings for each of the embellished ver-
   sions of the learning activity were significantly higher than the
   mean ranking of the no-fantasy version,
   t(46) =
   7.80, p <
   .001;
   t(46) =
   6.99, p <
   .001;
   and /(46) = 3.92, p <
   .001,
   for compari-
   sons of the no-fantasy version with the
   detective,
   the pirate, and
   the space versions of the activity, respectively.
   Similarly, in the second session, these children proved more
   likely to actually choose to play with one of the fantasy versions
   of the activities than with the no-fantasy version. Only 6.4% of
   the children selected the no-fantasy version, whereas 36.2%,
   29.8%,
   and 27.6% chose the pirate, detective, and space ver-
   sions,
   respectively, x2
   (3,
   N = 47) = 9.43, p < .05. As might be
   expected, childrenʼs stated preferences in the first session
   proved highly correlated with their choices in the second ses-
   sion. Only 4 students chose an activity that they had not previ-
   ously rated as their top choice.
   Finally, on neither measure were there any preference differ-
   ences between boys and
   girls;
   both showed the same preference
   for the fantasy versions of the activity. In addition, on neither
   measure did there appear to be any dramatic differences in the
   appeal of the various fantasy versions of the learning activities.
   Instead, childrenʼs specific fantasy preferences seemed nearly

   evenly spread across the three fantasies, thus setting the stage
   for our second study.
   Study 2: Effects of Fantasy Contexts on Learning
   What difference, then, does it make if learning is more fun?
   Will children given equal exposure to different versions of
   identical instructional activities show different levels of learn-
   ing as a function of the motivational appeal of those activities?
   In view of the demonstrated increases in interest produced in
   Study
   1
   by the addition of simple fantasy embellishments, in
   Study 2, we examined the consequences for learning of these
   differences in motivational appeal, controlling for the time
   spent with the learning activities.
   Thus,
   Study 2 examined the effects on childrenʼs learning of
   embedding identical instructional materials in the various fan-
   tasy contexts examined in Study 1. In this second experiment,
   third-grade children worked, during four successive training
   sessions, with graphics commands from the Logo program-
   ming language, under one of three conditions. In a no-fantasy
   control condition, students were given a series of abstract prob-
   lems to solve during four instructional sessions. In two fantasy
   conditions, the identical problems were presented within a fan-
   tasy problem-solving context. In one of these groups, children
   were given their choice of three alternative fantasy contexts; in
   the other, children were assigned specific fantasies yoked to the
   choices of the other group. Children were tested, before and
   after exposure to these treatments, on their knowledge of Logo
   and of several underlying geometric concepts, providing an as-
   sessment of their learning from these different programs. Their
   retention of the material was examined 2 weeks later.
   Method
   Participants
   The sample included
   19
   male
   and
   13 female third-grade students
   from
   a
   private Catholic elementary school
   in the
   San Francisco Bay
   Area of California. These
   32
   children were randomly assigned, within
   sex,
   to
   one of three
   conditions:
   individualized
   fantasy,
   assigned fantasy,
   and no
   fantasy.
   Five children
   did not
   complete all seven sessions,
   so
   their data were
   not
   included.
   In the
   final sample, there were 10 chil-
   dren
   in the
   individualized-fantasy condition
   (6
   boys
   and 4
   girls),
   10
   children
   in
   the assigned-fantasy condition (5 boys and 5 girls),
   and 7
   children
   in the
   no-fantasy condition
   (5
   boys
   and 2
   girls). These
   27
   children in the
   final
   sample ranged in
   age
   from
   8
   to
   10 years
   (M= 8.77,
   SD
   =
   0.65) and came from predominantly lower-middle-income back-
   grounds,
   as
   estimated from parental occupations. None
   of
   the chil-
   dren, according to their parents,
   had
   prior programming experience.
   Experimenters
   The experimenters were six undergraduate psychology majors who
   administered
   all the
   lessons
   and
   assisted with pre-
   and
   posttesting.
   These experimenters first spent
   2 to 3
   hours learning Logoʼs basic
   commands.
   In
   addition, they spent approximately 6 hours practicing
   administering the lessons to each other, Louise Parker, and two pilot
   subjects. Louise Parker was also present
   at
   the school and assisted,
   if
   needed, with
   all
   pre-
   and posttests and with lesson administration.
   Procedure
   Session
   1:
   Pretest.
   The
   first
   session was devoted to pretesting. Prior
   to testing, all children were told that the experimenter
   was
   interested
   in how children learn with computers,
   and
   every effort was made
   to
   minimize perceptions of evaluative pressure. This was done by enlist-
   ing the children as our "assistants"
   in
   helping us to find out how well
   our new computer activities worked. Children were then pretested on
   their knowledge of basic geometric concepts underlying simple graph-
   ics programming in Logo
   (e.g.,
   estimation of line length and angle size
   and ability
   to
   follow directions), using
   a
   test that was based on mea-
   sures developed by Papert etal. (1979) and Milojkovic
   (1983/1984).
   In
   addition
   to
   these pretest measures, composite national percentile
   scores on a standardized school achievement measure, the California
   Test
   of
   Basic
   Skills, (CTBS), were available for all students.
   Children also filled
   out
   several pretest measures
   of
   their general
   academic motivation, including abbreviated versions
   of
   Harterʼs
   In-
   trinsic Motivation (1981)
   and
   Perceived Competence (1982) Scales,
   and they completed additional items measuring their self-rated enjoy-
   ment
   of,
   and self-perceived competence in, academic subjects. Scales
   of test anxiety (Sarason, Lighthall, Davidson,
   Waite,
   &
   Ruebush, 1960)
   and locus
   of
   control
   for
   academic achievement outcomes (Crandall,
   Katovsky, & Crandall, 1965) were also administered. All instructions
   and questions
   for
   these measures were read aloud,
   and the
   experi-
   menters assisted children
   who
   were having difficulty following
   in-
   structions. Total testing time was approximately 30 min.
   These affective and motivational pretest measures were included
   to
   examine the possibility that our experimental effects might differ
   as
   a
   function
   of
   prior differences
   in
   childrenʼs motivational orientations.
   Using median splits
   for
   each
   of
   these measures, however,
   the
   data
   revealed
   no
   significant interactions of these prior motivational orienta-
   tions with experimental conditions. Hence, these measures
   are not
   discussed further.
   Sessions
   2
   through
   5: The
   lessons.
   In
   the second through
   fifth
   ses-
   sions,
   children received instruction
   in the
   elementary concepts
   in-
   volved in using Logo turtle graphics (Papert,
   1980;
   Papert et
   al.,
   1979)
   and were asked
   to
   complete
   a
   graded progression
   of
   exercises using
   what they had been taught. Children participated, in groups of
   5
   or 6,
   in experimental sessions on
   4
   consecutive
   days.
   During these sessions,
   each child worked
   at a
   separate Apple 11+ computer,
   and
   each child
   was assigned
   an
   experimenter who
   sat
   with that child
   and
   provided
   assistance if needed.
   During Session
   2,
   all children were given a common introduction
   to
   the commands that they could use
   to
   move the cursor forward, back-
   ward, left, and right to make line drawings on the
   screen.
   The children
   were also taught commands that sent the cursor
   "home"
   to the middle
   of the screen and that erased the screen entirely. This lesson
   proceeded
   slowly and lasted approximately
   30
   min.
   At the end of the instructional
   period,
   a
   test was administered
   to
   ensure that all children
   had
   mas-
   tered these basic
   commands.
   All children
   were
   successful. During this
   first lesson, the experimenters remained blind to experimental condi-
   tion. At the end of the session, the experimenters opened sealed enve-
   lopes containing childrenʼs assignments to conditions.
   At this point, the treatment of children began to differ
   by
   condition.
   Children assigned to the individualized-fantasy condition were inter-
   viewed individually and told the following:
   When you come back next time, you can play one of these com-
   puter
   activities.
   Listen carefully
   so
   that you can pick which one of
   these activities you want to do when we meet next
   time.
   \bu
   will
   be doing the same activity on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
   afternoon.
   So,
   think carefully about which activity you would like
   to do the most.
   The experimenters then showed and read the following list of choices
   to the children: (1) Pirate Treasure Hunt (in this activity, pirates
   travel

   around and hunt for
   treasure),
   (2)
   Mission
   Space
   Search
   (in
   this activity,
   astronauts
   fly
   around and look for new
   planets),
   and
   (3)
   Clue Detective
   Agency (in this activity, detectives hunt for criminals). The
   activities
   presented to children in the assigned-fantasy condition were then
   yoked to the choices of children in the individualized-fantasy group.
   To
   control for time spent with experimenters, children in the other two
   conditions were also individually interviewed; the experimenters
   asked these children about the types of games they liked to play.
   For the remaining instructional
   sessions,
   children in the two fantasy
   and the no-fantasy conditions worked
   on
   formally identical, bu. subtly
   different, versions of each
   activity.
   In the no-fantasy control condition,
   children were given
   a
   standard sequence of instruction and a standard
   series of exercises (e.g., connecting objects, negotiating mazes, and
   drawing simple geometric shapes), all involving abstract line drawings
   and simple geometric shapes. In the two fantasy conditions, children
   were given identical instruction and mathematically identical exer-
   cises.
   The only difference between the experimental conditions and
   the control condition was that the material in the former groups was
   embedded in a fantasy problem-solving context designed to increase
   the intrinsic motivational appeal of the
   activities.
   For students in these
   groups, for
   instance,
   mazes became
   catacombs,
   secret
   passages,
   or city
   streets.
   Overall, the differences between the fantasy and no-fantasy lessons
   were
   quite
   subtle.
   Three stories that corresponded
   to
   the three fantasies
   —pirates, space, and detectives—and that used the exercises as plot
   devices were written. Following a sentence or two introducing each
   fantasy, these stories differed only in the substitution of phrases
   (e.g.,
   "land on each planet" vs. "touch each circle"). The stories continued
   over the course of the
   lessons
   and
   were
   simply illustrated. For example,
   in the pirates story, the circles in the first exercise were replaced
   by
   simple line drawings of
   pirates.
   At the center of the screen was a line
   drawing of a pirate
   ship.
   Instead of being asked simply to connect the
   circles to the central point, children were asked to "go meet the other
   pirates and bring them back to the
   ship."
   Similarly, in a later connect-
   the-circles game, computer-drawn treasure islands that the children
   were asked to visit and plunder replaced the
   circles.
   Subsequently, one
   of the mazes was said to represent a winding tunnel and the other the
   inside of an evil wizardʼs treasure-laden castle. At the end of a final
   lesson, the pirates discovered that their ship had been wrecked, and
   the shape commands were offered as a more efficient means of "re-
   building" or redrawing the
   ship.
   The other fantasies used the exercises
   in a similar manner
   (e.g.,
   circles were replaced by planets and a rocket
   ship in the space story). In addition, in each of these cases, the
   cursor
   was given a name and served as the protagonist of the fantasy.
   More specifically, in Session 3, children were presented with three
   structured
   exercises.
   In the
   first,
   five
   Gircles
   appeared in
   a
   semicircle in
   the upper half of the screen, and students were instructed to connect
   the circles. In the second, children were asked to connect six circles
   placed in a full circle covering both halves of the screen. In the
   third,
   children were asked to navigate a maze by giving directions to the
   cursor. The maze was designed such that children could not take
   "short cuts" through the walls. If they attempted to do so or did so by
   accident, they would "bounce"
   back.
   Finally,
   children
   were
   given some
   time during which they could practice the commands they had learned
   by making up their own game until the end of the
   session.
   This lesson
   took approximately 40 min.4
   During Session
   4,
   the children
   were
   asked to navigate
   a
   second maze
   and to draw various geometric shapes. They were then given circular
   stickers of several colors which they could place on the screen to en-
   hance their drawings. In the no-fantasy condition, all of the stickers
   that the children received were unadorned; in the fantasy
   conditions,
   a
   few of the stickers had been embellished with simple icons relevant to
   the fantasy
   (e.g.,
   a treasure chest or
   a
   deserted
   island).
   It
   was
   hoped that
   the use of stickers would make the play more involving. At the end of
   this lesson there
   was
   a free-drawing period. This lesson took approxi-
   mately 40 min.
   Finally, in Session 5, the children were given more practice with
   drawing shapes. They were also taught several special shape com-
   mands that are not an inherent part of the Logo programming lan-
   guage but that were created specifically for this experiment. At the
   end
   of this last instructional session, there was again a brief period of
   unstructured activity. This last lesson took approximately 30 min.
   Sessions 6 and
   7:
   Posttesting.
   During Session 6, held on the day
   immediately after the last lesson, children were tested on their knowl-
   edge of
   Logo
   turtle graphics. The Logo Turtle Graphics Test (LTGT)
   developed for this purpose involved eight programming problems de-
   signed to assess childrenʼs understanding of, and ability to use, all
   the
   Logo procedures they had been taught. Half of these items asked stu-
   dents to give the commands necessary to produce a given picture; the
   other half asked students to draw the picture that would be produced
   by a given series of
   commands.
   This test constituted our measure of
   direct learning. The more abstract Geometric Concepts Test (GCT)
   was also readministered, to test for generalized learning.
   In addition to these learning measures, several additional attitu-
   dinal measures were administered. Children in all conditions were
   asked to answer, using 11 -point Likert scales (from
   0 = not at
   all to
   10
   =
   very very
   much),
   how much would they like to take another computer
   class,
   how much they liked the computer games they had played, and
   how much they liked working with the computer. For children in the
   two fantasy conditions, an additional question asked how much they
   liked the story that went with the computer games. Finally, two addi-
   tional questions asked for relative evaluations of how the computer
   activity compared with childrenʼs favorite board games and with their
   favorite subjects in school. On both of these last items, children were
   asked to indicate if the computer activity was
   (1)
   a
   lot more
   fun, (2) a
   little more
   fun, (3)
   as much
   fun,
   (4)
   almost as
   much
   fun, (5) a
   little less
   fun,
   or
   (6)
   a
   lot less
   fun.
   During Session 7, which took place 2 weeks after the last lesson,
   both the GCT and the LTGT were administered a final time. Thus,
   both immediate and delayed posttests of learning were obtained. The
   maximum score on the GCT was 43. The maximum score on the
   LTGT was 24. In addition, during this last session, one set of self-re-
   port measures initially included in the pretest battery was readminis-
   tered. Thus, students were asked to report on their liking for, and
   their
   perceived competence at, school mathematics and school in general.
   Results
   Preliminary Analyses
   Initial analyses were performed to determine whether there
   were interactions between experimental condition and either
   studentsʼ gender or their general academic achievement
   (as
   as-
   sessed by their CTBS
   scores).
   In neither analysis was there any
   evidence of an interaction of these variables with experimental
   condition. Therefore, the data were collapsed across both
   gender and initial achievement scores. As expected, however,
   CTBS scores did prove correlated with each of our cognitive
   pre-
   and posttest measures. As a result, these scores were em-
   ployed as a covariate for analyses on those measures.
   4 Note that these short unstructured activity periods were
   fixed
   and
   of equivalent length for all students. Hence, they do not provide a
   measure of student choice or persistence that could serve as a further
   indicator of studentsʼ intrinsic motivation.

   In addition, preliminary analyses revealed no significant
   dif-
   ferences
   on any
   of the measures between students
   in
   the individ-
   ualized-fantasy
   and the
   assigned-fantasy conditions.
   For pur-
   poses
   of
   further analysis, then, these
   two
   groups were
   com-
   bined, providing
   a
   comparison between children
   in
   the fantasy
   versus
   the
   no-fantasy conditions.
   Specific Learning
   The most direct test of our hypotheses concerning the effects
   of fantasy contexts
   on
   learning involved
   a
   comparison
   of
   the
   performance
   of
   students working with
   and
   without
   a
   fantasy
   context
   on
   measures
   of
   their learning
   of
   the specific material
   they had been taught.
   In
   the present
   case,
   these questions were
   best addressed
   by the
   data from
   the
   LTGT.
   Immediate

   To
   examine
   the
   effects
   of
   fantasy context
   on
   childrenʼs understanding
   of, and
   ability
   to
   use,
   the
   material explicitly presented to them,
   a
   one-way analy-
   sis
   of covariance (ANCOVA) was computed on childrenʼs scores
   on
   the
   LTGT, using childrenʼs
   CTBS
   math
   scores as a
   covariate.

   in
   the fantasy conditions showed significantly more learning than

   no-fantasy condition,

   Retention
   of material. Given these significant effects
   on ini-
   tial learning,
   it
   is
   of
   interest
   to
   know how effectively this initial
   learning was retained
   2
   weeks later. Hence,
   a
   comparable one-
   way ANCOVA, again using CTBS math scores
   as a
   covariate,
   was done using studentsʼ subsequent retention
   of
   the material
   taught
   as the
   dependent measure.
   On the
   delayed Logo post-
   test, once again, children
   in the
   fantasy conditions performed
   better than those
   in the
   no-fantasy condition,

   to
   these measures

   Self-Report Measures
   Three clusters
   of
   self-report measures were also obtained
   at
   the
   end of
   the
   last session.
   A
   first
   pair
   of
   measures asked chil-
   dren directly how much they liked "the games they played" and
   "working with
   the
   computer."
   On
   these measures,
   a
   clear ceil-
   ing effect
   was
   obtained. Over 80%
   of all
   subjects responded
   with the top
   rating;
   means ranged from 9.30 to 9.42 and did not
   differ by condition.
   The last self-report measures, administered
   2
   weeks later,
   asked students to rate their liking for, and competence
   at,
   math-
   ematics
   and
   school
   in
   general.
   Using the
   pretest
   scores
   available
   on this measure as
   a
   covariate,
   the
   results more closely resem-
   bled
   our
   learning effects (M= 24.58
   for
   the fantasy conditions,
   and
   M
   =
   18.90 for the
   no-fantasy condition). However, these
   differences, although more pronounced, also
   did not
   achieve
   statistical significance,
   F(l,
   14)
   =
   2.52,
   p
   =
   .125.
   Finally,
   we
   examined studentsʼ records during
   the
   learning
   sessions
   for evidence of greater interest or involvement. Unfortu-
   nately
   our
   "automated" recording system broke down early,
   leaving us with limited data from only half our subjects
   (9
   in the
   fantasy condition
   and
   5
   in
   the no-fantasy condition). Nonethe-
   less,
   we did
   find evidence
   of our
   fantasy condition subjects
   proving more effective
   (M=
   4.44)
   in
   the central task of the first
   learning session (touching
   a
   series
   of
   circles)
   than
   our
   no-fan-
   tasy condition subjects
   (M=
   2.60),
   t{\2)
   =
   2.26,
   p
   <
   .05.
   That
   this finding
   may
   have been
   the
   result
   of
   a
   deeper involvement
   by the fantasy condition subjects
   is
   further suggested
   by
   the fact
   that all four
   of
   the
   students who succeeded
   at
   this task without
   misses
   or
   backtracking were
   in the
   fantasy conditions.

   MAKING LEARNING MORE FUN631
   General Discussion
   Taken together, the present results demonstrate that in-
   creased learning may occur when instructional materials are
   made more intrinsically motivating for students. In particular,
   these findings illustrate two important benefits of
   the
   instruc-
   tional strategy of embedding educational materials in appeal-
   ing fantasy contexts. First, the findings of Study
   1
   suggest that
   the addition of even relatively minimal fantasy embellishments
   can significantly enhance the motivational appeal of common
   educational activities for children. In situations in which chil-
   dren may be allowed to determine how much time they spend
   with different activities, such differences in interest may ulti-
   mately result in differences in learning, simply as a function of
   the amount of time children spend with the activity. At the
   same time, the results of Study 2 provide evidence of an even
   more profound effect on learning of embedding instructional
   materials in
   a
   fantasy
   context.
   Even when the time that students
   were allowed to spend at the activity
   (as
   well as the basic struc-
   ture of the activity itself) was explicitly controlled, as was the
   case in Study 2, the provision of an appealing fantasy context
   still produced significant increases in student learning.
   Interestingly, these effects appeared equally strong, in the
   present
   studies,
   whether students
   were
   allowed
   to
   select
   an
   indi-
   vidualized fantasy or were assigned a fantasy independent of
   their particular preferences. In
   this
   context,
   however, it
   is
   worth
   noting that our
   sample
   of fantasies
   was small
   and that the fanta-
   sies we
   used
   were
   deliberately chosen
   to be
   of general applicabil-
   ity and appeal. Had the range of options included fantasies that
   some students found wholly inappropriate or uninteresting, or
   even disturbing or disgusting, the ability to select a fantasy of
   greater personal relevance or interest might have proved more
   important. Nor did we emphasize to students in the assigned-
   fantasy condition that we were explicitly restricting their
   choice, which might also
   have
   enhanced the difference between
   fantasy conditions. At the same time, the fact that similar ef-
   fects were obtained with several different fantasies serves to
   illustrate the potential generality of
   the
   results.
   Alternative Mechanisms
   Although we have concentrated on the manner in which the
   provision of a fantasy context
   may
   enhance learning
   by
   increas-
   ing the childʼs level of motivation, it is possible that there are
   also other, more purely cognitive, processes that may have con-
   tributed to the observed effects. Obviously, there
   is a
   large litera-
   ture attesting to the power of visual imagery
   (e.g.,
   Bower, 1972;
   Paivio, 1971), the importance of
   having
   a coherent perspective
   or point of view (e.g., Anderson & Pichert, 1978; Pichert &
   Anderson, 1977), and the significance of a concrete representa-
   tion of problems (e.g., Anderson, 1980; Schoenfeld, 1985) as
   determinants of recall in humans.
   However, the present studies would seem a priori to provide
   a setting in which one might least expect such effects to be
   important. First, there were few explicit memory demands in-
   volved in the learning tasks; indeed, the relevant commands
   remained posted during both the training session and the test-
   ing sessions. It was, instead, the procedural knowledge of
   how
   to use those basic commands efficiently that was at issue for
   these students. Second, as is the case with any use of Logo
   graphics, the task itself
   was
   inherently concrete and
   visual,
   even
   in the no-fantasy condition. Third, as
   is
   also the case with nor-
   mal classes in Logo, students in the no-fantasy condition, as
   well as the fantasy conditions, were explicitly encouraged to
   "take the point of
   view"
   of
   the
   cursor and to move themselves
   about as they had instructed the cursor to
   move,
   as
   a device for
   determining what effects different commands would have on
   the screen.
   In a similar fashion, one might consider interpreting the ef-
   fects of fantasy in this study in terms of the idea of context-de-
   pendence, as applied in the literature on "everyday cognition"
   (e.g., Lave, 1988;
   Rogoff,
   1990; Rogoff
   &
   Lave, 1984). In this
   literature, a common finding is that people frequently perform
   tasks quite competently and successfully in concrete and highly
   familiar situations that they are unable to perform when those
   tasks are presented out of context, as on traditional paper-and-
   pencil tests of
   the
   material presented in school.
   In the present case, however, our significant learning results
   appear on measures involving precisely the sort of abstract and
   decontextualized paper-and-pencil tests on which, in
   the
   every-
   day cognition literature, one does not normally find effects.
   Coupled with our data showing
   some
   generalization of learning
   —on even more abstract and out-of-context tests administered
   2 weeks later—the present findings seem more contradictory
   to,
   then derivable from, the everyday cognition literature.
   Educational Implications
   Whatever the underlying mechanisms, the present findings
   have implications for the design of instructional materials and
   exercises for children. Certainly, the motivational and instruc-
   tional benefits observed are consistent with recent calls for the
   reemergence of a "project-centered" approach to curriculum
   design
   (e.g.,
   Katz
   &
   Chard, 1989), in which instructional objec-
   tives are
   integrated into meaningful long-term
   activities
   deliber-
   ately designed and selected for their potential to sustain high
   levels of intrinsic interest.
   Our findings also have the special relevance for the domain
   of computer-based education. In the current studies, the use of
   the computer
   was
   something of an incidental by-product of our
   desire to hold completely constant other features of instruction,
   while simultaneously varying the provision of fantasy contexts.
   There is no reason to believe, however, that the results would
   not generalize to settings in which instruction is provided by
   tutors,
   books, peers, television, or any other medium of learn-
   ing. As many authors have noted (and any observer of video
   games will undoubtedly concur), the computer does make it
   particularly easy for instructional designers to create intricate,
   involving, and illustrated fantasy contexts into which educa-
   tional activities can be embedded
   (e.g.,
   Chabay
   &
   Sherwood, in
   press;
   Dugdale & Kibbey, 1980; Snyder
   &
   Palmer, 1986).
   Within the specific domain of educational computing, how-
   ever, the use of fantasy contexts has been a topic of heated
   debate (Condry
   &
   Keith,
   1983;
   Greenfield,
   1984;
   Lepper, 1985).
   Whereas proponents have been quick to note the motivational
   advantages of such procedures (e.g., Lesgold, 1982; Loftus &
   Loftus,
   1983;
   Snyder
   &
   Palmer, 1986), opponents have viewed
   such attempts to "sugarcoat" instruction as ill-advised and
   likely to produce less lasting and less efficient learning (e.g.,

   Bowers,
   1988;
   DAttore,
   1981;
   Psotka,
   1982).
   Certainly, the pres-
   ent data provide one demonstration of a positive effect on both
   motivation and learning of an appropriately planned use of
   fantasy contexts.
   At the same time, it
   is
   important to
   be
   clear about the evident
   limitations of the present effects, because quite obviously the
   mere presentation of abstract problems in the form of
   a
   story
   will guarantee neither increased interest nor enhanced learn-
   ing. Lepper and Malone (1987), for instance, provide clear ex-
   amples of
   cases
   in which inappropriate fantasy elements com-
   pete with educational elements for the learnerʼs attention—ac-
   tivities in which the goals of involvement in the fantasy and of
   learning the material are conflicting, rather than congruent. In
   these instances, increased motivation may actually lead to de-
   creased learning.
   Two
   other significant limitations to the use of fantasy embel-
   lishments are illustrated in what is perhaps the most obvious
   and widespread contrary case—the notorious difficulty of, and
   childrenʼs widespread aversion to, the use of word problems in
   the teaching of mathematics (e.g., Resnick & Ford, 1981;
   Schoenfeld, 1985). On the one hand, in the typical mathemati-
   cal word problem, the use of a story creates
   a
   dramatic increase
   in the difficulty of the studentsʼ task, because they must now
   translate the story into an equation before attempting to solve
   that equation. On the other hand, the stories used in these
   problems are also virtually devoid of interest value. There are
   no characters with whom students would identify, no meaning-
   ful goals, indeed no plots to be followed (cf. Anderson et al.,
   1987).
   Under such circumstances, even the purely motivational
   benefits of fantasy may not occur.
   In addition, there may be important developmental limita-
   tions on the use of fantasy embellishments as a strategy for
   enhancing studentsʼ motivation and learning. Certainly, one
   would expect the sort of minimal interventions used in the
   current studies to lose their effectiveness with older students;
   clearly, the most vocal proponents of project-centered curricula
   have focused on schooling in the elementary years. Whether
   there are fundamental differences in the processes involved or
   simply an increase in the complexity and richness required for
   a
   fantasy to
   be
   of interest to older students remains an interesting
   topic for future study.
   On the other hand, it is equally clear that the need for tech-
   niques to enhance student interest in traditional educational
   materials may actually increase with age. Young children, for
   example, seem continuously involved in learning; indeed, the
   idea of a preschooler displaying "motivational difficulties" in
   learning to walk, to talk, or to explore
   his
   or her environment is
   almost unthinkable. By contrast, as children progress through
   school "motivation" seems increasingly likely to be identified as
   "a problem." (Holt, 1964; Jackson, 1968; Lepper & Greene,
   1978;
   Silberman, 1970). In fact, explicit survey data obtained
   from school-age students display a continuing decrease in re-
   ported intrinsic motivation toward school work from grade
   three through grade nine (Harter, 1981).
   In part, such discouraging trends may be a consequence of
   the progressive "decontextualization" of learning that occurs as
   students move from grade to grade (Bruner, 1961, 1966;
   Condry, 1977). Both the sorts of projects commonly recalled in
   the reminiscences of students discussed in the beginning of this
   article and the techniques of fantasy involvement that have
   been empirically documented in the studies reported herein
   may be seen as attempts to combat this problem. The educa-
   tional challenge of the current findings, then, remains appar-
   ent: How can the sorts of strategies illustrated in this article
   best be used to make learning simultaneously more enjoyable
   and more effective?

   ... To improve students' performance in remembering declarative
   knowledge and enhancing learning effectiveness in the classroom,
   fantasy elements serve as a powerful tool (Zuo et al., 2023).
   Incorporating fantasy literature into the curriculum shifts the
   traditional monotonous teaching-learning process into active, joyful
   learning (Parker & Lepper, 1992). So, fostering imagination and
   creativity is crucial for preparing children for success in the future
   in a world that is becoming more complex (Lack & Kumar, 2003). ...
   ... During the last couple of decades, studies on fantasy have explored
   how it can be used as a pedagogical tool to encourage students'
   engagement in the learning process, to foster creativity and divergent
   thinking among learners. Parker and Lepper (1992) demonstrated that
   fantasy-oriented environments and activities significantly boost
   children's motivation and learning. In an era characterized by rapid
   technological advancements, hectic social systems, and existential
   anxieties, fantasy provides a sanctuary where we can immerse ourselves
   in alternate realities, mythical realms, and epic adventures (Bacon &
   Charlesford, 2018). ...
   ... The importance of fantasy in our lives lies in its profound impact
   on mental, emotional, and social well-being. Research conducted across
   the globe highlights the multifaceted role of fantasy as a pedagogical
   tool and as a cognitive, creative, and cultural faculty that shapes
   various aspects of human experience (Zuo et al., 2023;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022;Bunce & Woolley, 2021;Richert &Schlesinger, 2022;Parker & Lepper,
   1992;Seja & Russ, 1999). The importance of fantasy as a cognitive
   function essential to emotional regulation has been explored in various
   studies (Seja & Russ, 1999;Bacon & Charlesford, 2018;Shiota & Nomura,
   2022). ...

     * Ananta Kumar

   The present study explores research trends in fantasy by conducting a
   bibliometric analysis of literature indexed in the Scopus database. The
   PRISMA framework was employed to identify and select articles from the
   Scopus database. A search of the Scopus database using the term
   "fantasy" resulted in 7,177 documents from which 502 articles were
   shortlisted based on inclusion-exclusion criteria and manual screening.
   The selected metadata were exported in CSV format and analyzed using
   the R package Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software for bibliometric
   analysis and visualization. The study identifies the most influential
   authors, articles, journals, countries, keywords, and trends in
   publication over the years. The most cited document was "Brexit
   Populism and Fantasies of Fulfilment" by Browning, C.S. (2023) with 88
   citations, while Personality and Social Psychology emerged as the most
   influential source with 76 citations. Results show that although the
   number of publications fluctuated slightly, there has been an
   exponential overall growth. Research on fantasy as a faculty shows a
   positive research trend, which will turn it into an emerging research
   field.

   ... But even if we narrow our focus to only those playful or creative
   endeavors that do present genuine fantasy (i.e., impossible entities or
   events), researchers have successfully used fantasy contexts to improve
   learning. For example, Parker and Lepper (1992) had children engage in
   quasi-fantasy adventures (planetary exploration; searching for buried
   treasure; or playing detective and hunting down criminals) in the
   context of cognitive-spatial tasks. Children who engaged in a fantasy
   context reported higher intrinsic motivation and exhibited higher
   scores on these tasks. ...
   ... Although Parker and Lepper (1992) speculated that the relative
   success of their fantasy contexts was due to increasing interest and
   motivation (i.e., "fun"), there is a body of recent work suggesting
   that the fantasy content itself might be beneficial for both adults'
   and children's reasoning abilities. For example, Weisberg et al. (2015)
   aimed to teach new vocabulary words to preschool-aged children,
   presenting half of these children with new words in storybooks that had
   realistic themes and presenting the other half of the children with new
   words in storybooks that had fantastical themes. ...

   Human beings are generally captivated by fantasy—a distinct form of
   fiction—but there has been relatively little research in the behavioral
   sciences specifically on this subject (as defined in this article).
   This article integrates research from different areas of psychology and
   the humanities to provide a theoretical and methodological foundation
   from which behavioral scientists can conduct systematic empirical
   investigations of the relationship between fantasy and diverse
   psychological phenomena. First, this article establishes a working
   definition of fantasy, differentiating fantasy from other types of
   fiction (e.g., horror, science-fiction) and magical thinking/beliefs
   (e.g., superstition, religion). Second, we review the cognitive bases
   for creating and engaging with fantasy. Third, we discuss extant
   research on fantasy in multiple areas of psychology (e.g., learning,
   clinical/counseling, creativity, terror management) using both child
   and adult samples, while reviewing key individual differences in
   fantasy orientation (e.g., fantasy proneness, absorption) and
   highlighting gaps that require more empirical research. This review
   illustrates that it is worthwhile to expand research efforts on this
   construct throughout the behavioral sciences.

   Elementary Teachers' Perspectives of Mathematics Problem Solving
   Strategies
   Article
     * May 2015

     * Faye Bruun

   Participants in this study were asked to report what strategies were
   most often used in their attempts to foster their students’ problem
   solving abilities. Participants included 70 second through fifth-grade
   elementary teachers from 42 schools in a large state of the south
   central region in the US. Data analyses of the interviews revealed that
   none of the educators utilized all problem solving strategies
   recommended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Further
   examination of the interviews indicated that having their students draw
   a picture and identify key information was the teachers’ most taught
   word problem strategy. Here, we provide insight of the reported
   teachers’ strategies and the need for more explicit instruction of
   problem solving strategies when educating mathematics teachers.

   A case study of Divan poetry
   Thesis

     * Oct 2024

     * Oya Uysal Oya Uysal

   It is expected that this research will create a new perspective in
   introducing, conveying, and instilling aesthetic appreciation for the
   form and content characteristics of divan poetry to students. This aim
   is expected to be realized through learning environments where material
   examples developed with an interdisciplinary approach serve in the
   teaching of Divan poetry in Turkish language and literature. In the
   research, using an interdisciplinary approach, example materials were
   created by relating divan poetry texts from Turkish literature—suitable
   for the secondary education level—to other relevant disciplines. It is
   thought that the created materials will serve as an example for future
   materials to be supported by appropriate teaching methods and
   techniques. In the learning environments served by the material
   examples prepared with an interdisciplinary approach, it is expected
   that students will not feel limited by the thinking patterns of a
   specific discipline and will subsequently see information and
   experiences from different disciplines within certain concepts,
   thereby: • gaining critical and creative thinking skills, • developing
   problem-solving and independent decision-making abilities, • achieving
   easier, more permanent, meaningful, willing, confident, and efficient
   learning, • gaining an interdisciplinary perspective to achieve the
   goals of the environment or overcome encountered problems, • realizing
   the expected learning objectives at the end of the learning and
   teaching process. The research is qualitative and employs a descriptive
   survey model. To achieve the aims and sub-aims of the research,
   relevant publications and studies were reviewed, and the obtained data
   were analyzed using a descriptive and interpretative technique. With
   the obtained data, materials were prepared for the Turkish language and
   literature course on divan poetry using an interdisciplinary approach.
   With these materials, it is aimed to arouse interest in divan
   literature among today's students, to introduce them to the richness of
   genres and forms in divan literature, the subtle imagination,
   linguistic skill, and intellectual horizon, to make them aware of the
   traditional expression forms, and the richness of topics and content,
   and to enable students with a tendency towards literary taste in this
   direction to discover themselves. The study, which includes theoretical
   information, designed materials, and the stages and interpretations of
   the process of implementing these materials, also contains suggestions
   for relevant researchers and educators to serve as examples for similar
   studies. It is planned for the study to be transformed into an
   experimental study in the future.

   Following the global COVID-19 pandemic, digital learning environments
   have gained in importance in education all around the world. A new
   digital learning format called a “Digital Learning Module” (DLM) was
   developed within the Physics Education Research (PER) group at CERN,
   consisting of a series of prerecorded explanatory and experiment
   videos, interactive elements, an interactive simulation experiment, and
   expert interviews. So far, one DLM has been created on the topic of
   positron emission tomography (PET). Aiming to establish a set of
   effective design principles that can be employed in the design of
   future DLMs or similar digital learning environments, the goal of this
   research is to evaluate the already existing PET DLM. In doing so, this
   research brings together different theoretical and empirical studies,
   in order to identify design principles fitting the format of the DLM.
   It also reviews key physics literature on PET to identify its
   disciplinary-relevant aspects. First, an analysis of the PET DLM was
   performed in terms of the identified design principles and
   disciplinary-relevant aspects. Then, nine semistructured interviews
   were conducted with high-school students from Greece and Austria as
   they worked through the PET DLM. A qualitative content analysis of the
   interview transcripts has determined the set of effective design
   principles that will constitute the foundation of future DLMs developed
   by the CERN PER group and can serve as a starting point and reference
   for researchers developing similar digital learning environments
   elsewhere. Published by the American Physical Society 2025

     * Cheryl Taitague

   There is intense interest in computer games. A total of 65 percent of
   all American households play computer games, and sales of such games
   increased 22.9 percent last year. The average amount of game playing
   time was found to be 13.2 hours per week. The popularity and market
   success of games is evident from both the increased earnings from
   games, over $7 Billion in 2005, and from the fact that over 200
   academic institutions worldwide now offer game related programs of
   study.In view of the intense interest in computer games educators and
   trainers, in business, industry, the government, and the military would
   like to use computer games to improve the delivery of instruction.
   Computer Games and Instruction is intended for these educators and
   trainers. It reviews the research evidence supporting use of computer
   games, for instruction, and also reviews the history of games in
   general, in education, and by the military. In addition chapters
   examine gender differences in game use, and the implications of games
   for use by lower socio-economic students, for students’ reading, and
   for contemporary theories of instruction. Finally, well known scholars
   of games will respond to the evidence reviewed.

   Using ChatGPT to bring non-player characters to life: Effects on
   students’ storyline-driven game-based writing learning

   This study introduces a novel design approach to game-based learning by
   integrating ChatGPT into the development of non-player characters
   (NPCs) within storylines. This integration seeks to enhance
   interactivity with student players and foster an immersive, dynamic
   learning environment. We applied this approach in English as a Foreign
   Language (EFL) writing classrooms to examine its impact on both the
   affective and cognitive aspects of student writing learning, as well as
   their writing performance. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the
   study involved two classes of Chinese undergraduate students. One class
   (n = 42) engaged with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, while the other class (n =
   43) interacted with conventional NPCs in a storyline-based game
   designed to enhance argumentative writing skills. Quantitative data
   were collected through questionnaires assessing students’ intrinsic
   motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort
   regulation. Additionally, student essays were evaluated to compare
   writing performance across the two conditions. Qualitative data,
   including students’ chat histories with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, were
   gathered to investigate their interactions. The results indicated that
   engaging with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs positively influenced students’
   intrinsic motivation and situational interest, leading them to invest
   greater effort in completing learning tasks. Notably, interactions with
   ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs did not increase students’ cognitive load during
   the learning process. Moreover, students who interacted with
   ChatGPT-powered NPCs exhibited superior writing performance, producing
   essays that were significantly clearer, more elaborated, and more
   persuasive, while also more effectively addressing opposing viewpoints.
   Additionally, students employed various conversational strategies while
   interacting with these NPCs. This study not only advances our
   understanding of the role of generative artificial intelligence in
   educational contexts but also provides valuable insights for educators
   seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes through
   innovative instructional strategies.

   Achievement attributions and self-instructions under competitive and
   individualistic goal structures
   Article
   Full-text available
     * Jun 1984

     * Carole Ames Carole Ames

   Investigated whether competitive and individualistic goal structures
   elicit achievement cognitions that have been associated with helpless
   vs mastery-oriented children, respectively. 88 5th- and 6th-grade
   children were administered a novel achievement task in which a high vs
   low performance outcome was manipulated by varying the number of
   solvable puzzles across 2 sets of 6 puzzles, within either a
   competitive or individual goal structure. A "thought-matching"
   methodology was used to assess the type of frequency of Ss' thoughts.
   Results revealed that Ss made more ability attributions in the
   competitive than in the individual condition. In the individual
   condition, Ss displayed a mastery orientation in that they made more
   effort attributions and engaged in self-instructions and
   self-monitoring more than did Ss in the competitive condition. Ability
   attributions were predictive of Ss' positive and negative affective
   reactions. Results suggest that Ss were thinking about responses to the
   question "Was I smart?" in the competitive setting but were thinking
   about "How can I do this task?" in the individual setting. It is
   suggested that getting children to think about how to improve their
   performance may not be compatible with the focus of attention in
   competitive situations. (29 ref)

   Children's Beliefs in Their Own Control of Reinforcements in

     * Vaughn J. Crandall

   This study describes a scale for assessing children's beliefs that
   they, rather than other people, are responsible for their
   intellectual-academic successes and failures. Subscale scores assessing
   responsibility for successes and for failures were generally
   independent of each other. Split-half and test-retest reliabilities
   were moderately high. Normative data on 923 Ss in grades 3-12 indicate
   that self-responsibility is already established by third grade, that
   older girls give more self-responsible answers than older boys, and
   that slight but significant age changes occur in subscale scores
   dependent upon the sex of the child. Responsibility scores were
   moderately related to intelligence, ordinal position, and size of
   family, and inconsistently related to social class. Evidence of
   prediction to intellectual-achievement performance is presented.

   Cognition in Practice
   Book
     * Jul 1988

     * Jean Lave Jean Lave

   Most previous research on human cognition has focused on
   problem-solving, and has confined its investigations to the laboratory.
   As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental
   processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling -
   indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one
   particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving -
   out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing,
   she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is
   shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and
   its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human
   subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on
   mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in
   the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method,
   fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in
   its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of
   conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent
   social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of
   culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result
   is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of
   cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in
   which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to
   anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to
   culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists;
   and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize
   themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.
