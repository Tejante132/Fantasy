Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   for the final book The Wheel of Osheim can be found !!HERE!!

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

   51N6e0pAZTL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_
   51Z5Y+YLUUL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

   514vRUaeEHL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Age of Assassins (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    Empires of Dust by Anna Smith Spark.

   eod1
   eod2

   eod3

    1. The Court of Broken Knives (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    1. A Time of Dread (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. A Time of Blood (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

                 but also felt no need to carry on with the rest or try
                 his other work. I might revisit him as an author again at

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

       Nice to see Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne there, it doesn’t get
       nearly the love it deserves.

            Of course, all three are brilliant and all tie in together.👍
            I’d probably have her other trilogy on the list too but I’ve
            never gotten around to reading the final book.

                 OopS! My bad. Got series stuck in my mind. I do recommend
                 the two trilogies though. I’m looking forward to starting
                 Broken Empire soon and have another book by R.J. Barker,
                 which I’m hoping will turn out better than some reviews
                 I’ve seen.

                 No worries, it’s all good.👍📚 If I can find the time I
                 will definitely check them out.
                 Ah, do you mean The Bone Ships? I absolutely loved it and
                 many others did too but yeah, some middling reviews for
                 it around too.

            I’m not a Sanderson fan, I read and enjoyed the first Mistborn
            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

            Have never been able to get into Brandon Sanderson’s books and
            have tried so many times! Yet, I loved the way he finished the
            Wheel of Time series

       I’m so glad I came upon this post. Was in despair at having nothing
       interesting to read. But have started Prince of Thorns and am
       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review
   for the final book The Wheel of Osheim can be found !!HERE!!

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

   51N6e0pAZTL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_
   51Z5Y+YLUUL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

   514vRUaeEHL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Age of Assassins (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

       Some amazing selections a d most I haven’t read before. I
       definitely agree with lord of the rings.
       I really like this idea for trilogies as there are so many great
       ones.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

            Awesome! I haven’t read the last two books in his latest
            series yet but, I know his new one is set on the same world
            but years in the future and isn’t out until April (I think)
            next year, nice one! That was a stroke of luck, good for you

       Glad you included Robin Hobb’s trilogy of trilogies, as they’re
       really not complete on their own. 🙂
       Nice to see Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne there, it doesn’t get
       nearly the love it deserves.

            Of course, all three are brilliant and all tie in together.👍
            I’d probably have her other trilogy on the list too but I’ve
            never gotten around to reading the final book.

                 the two trilogies though. I’m looking forward to starting
                 Broken Empire soon and have another book by R.J. Barker,
                 which I’m hoping will turn out better than some reviews

            I’m not a Sanderson fan, I read and enjoyed the first Mistborn
            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

       I’m so glad I came upon this post. Was in despair at having nothing
       interesting to read. But have started Prince of Thorns and am
       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    Empires of Dust by Anna Smith Spark.

    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    1. A Time of Dread (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. A Time of Blood (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

                 enjoy the same books.

       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

       Oh man do you realise how many books you’ve added to my reading
       list 😉 I really should read more Mark Lawrence- I’ve just been
       reading Red Sister and it is pretty excellent, so whenever a space
       opens up in my TBR I will be ALL OVER that

            Red Sister is fantastic. I’m yet to read Grey Sister but it’s
            supposed to be awesome too. Both his other trilogies are great
            and different too.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

                 I read the first Mistborn book and overall I enjoyed it
                 but also felt no need to carry on with the rest or try
                 his other work. I might revisit him as an author again at

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   for the final book The Wheel of Osheim can be found !!HERE!!

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

   51N6e0pAZTL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_
   51Z5Y+YLUUL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

   514vRUaeEHL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Age of Assassins (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    Empires of Dust by Anna Smith Spark.

   eod1
   eod2

   eod3

    1. The Court of Broken Knives (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    1. A Time of Dread (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. A Time of Blood (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

                 but also felt no need to carry on with the rest or try
                 his other work. I might revisit him as an author again at

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

       Glad you included Robin Hobb’s trilogy of trilogies, as they’re
       really not complete on their own. 🙂
       Nice to see Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne there, it doesn’t get
       nearly the love it deserves.

            Of course, all three are brilliant and all tie in together.👍
            I’d probably have her other trilogy on the list too but I’ve
            never gotten around to reading the final book.

                 OopS! My bad. Got series stuck in my mind. I do recommend
                 the two trilogies though. I’m looking forward to starting
                 Broken Empire soon and have another book by R.J. Barker,
                 which I’m hoping will turn out better than some reviews
                 I’ve seen.

                 No worries, it’s all good.👍📚 If I can find the time I
                 will definitely check them out.
                 Ah, do you mean The Bone Ships? I absolutely loved it and
                 many others did too but yeah, some middling reviews for
                 it around too.

            I’m not a Sanderson fan, I read and enjoyed the first Mistborn
            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

            Have never been able to get into Brandon Sanderson’s books and
            have tried so many times! Yet, I loved the way he finished the
            Wheel of Time series

       I’m so glad I came upon this post. Was in despair at having nothing
       interesting to read. But have started Prince of Thorns and am
       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review
   for the final book The Wheel of Osheim can be found !!HERE!!

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

       definitely agree with lord of the rings.
       I really like this idea for trilogies as there are so many great
       ones.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

            Awesome! I haven’t read the last two books in his latest
            series yet but, I know his new one is set on the same world
            but years in the future and isn’t out until April (I think)
            next year, nice one! That was a stroke of luck, good for you

       Glad you included Robin Hobb’s trilogy of trilogies, as they’re
       really not complete on their own. 🙂
       Nice to see Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne there, it doesn’t get
       nearly the love it deserves.

            Of course, all three are brilliant and all tie in together.👍
            I’d probably have her other trilogy on the list too but I’ve
            never gotten around to reading the final book.

                 the two trilogies though. I’m looking forward to starting
                 Broken Empire soon and have another book by R.J. Barker,
                 which I’m hoping will turn out better than some reviews

            I’m not a Sanderson fan, I read and enjoyed the first Mistborn
            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

       I’m so glad I came upon this post. Was in despair at having nothing
       interesting to read. But have started Prince of Thorns and am
       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

    1. Age of Assassins (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    Empires of Dust by Anna Smith Spark.

    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    1. A Time of Dread (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. A Time of Blood (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

                 That sucks. Can’t be helped though as not everyone will
                 enjoy the same books.

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

            Red Sister is fantastic. I’m yet to read Grey Sister but it’s
            supposed to be awesome too. Both his other trilogies are great

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

                 but also felt no need to carry on with the rest or try
                 his other work. I might revisit him as an author again at

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   for the final book The Wheel of Osheim can be found !!HERE!!

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    The Wounded Kingdom by RJ Barker.

   51N6e0pAZTL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_
   51Z5Y+YLUUL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

   514vRUaeEHL._SX316_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Age of Assassins (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    Empires of Dust by Anna Smith Spark.

   eod1
   eod2

   eod3

    1. The Court of Broken Knives (2017) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    1. A Time of Dread (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    2. A Time of Blood (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

                 but also felt no need to carry on with the rest or try
                 his other work. I might revisit him as an author again at

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

            Awesome! I haven’t read the last two books in his latest
            series yet but, I know his new one is set on the same world
            but years in the future and isn’t out until April (I think)
            next year, nice one! That was a stroke of luck, good for you
            though.👍

       Glad you included Robin Hobb’s trilogy of trilogies, as they’re
       really not complete on their own. 🙂
       Nice to see Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne there, it doesn’t get
       nearly the love it deserves.

            Of course, all three are brilliant and all tie in together.👍
            I’d probably have her other trilogy on the list too but I’ve
            never gotten around to reading the final book.

                 OopS! My bad. Got series stuck in my mind. I do recommend
                 the two trilogies though. I’m looking forward to starting
                 Broken Empire soon and have another book by R.J. Barker,
                 which I’m hoping will turn out better than some reviews
                 I’ve seen.

                 No worries, it’s all good.👍📚 If I can find the time I
                 will definitely check them out.
                 Ah, do you mean The Bone Ships? I absolutely loved it and
                 many others did too but yeah, some middling reviews for
                 it around too.

            I’m not a Sanderson fan, I read and enjoyed the first Mistborn
            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

            Have never been able to get into Brandon Sanderson’s books and
            have tried so many times! Yet, I loved the way he finished the
            Wheel of Time series

       I’m so glad I came upon this post. Was in despair at having nothing
       interesting to read. But have started Prince of Thorns and am
       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.

Top Finished Fantasy Trilogies you should read.

   Aug 6, 2018May 8, 2020 Drew @ The Tattooed Book Geek

   fant

   Well, the title of the post is itself quite explanatory, I’m going to
   list the top finished fantasy trilogies that I have read and that I
   think every fantasy fan should read and if you’re not a fantasy fan
   “shudders, tuts and then shakes head” well, you just might find
   something that piques your interest on the list!

   Obviously, there are many other fantasy trilogies out there and these
   are only the ones that I have read and that are finished. 🙂 I also have
   another post with my five favourite finished fantasy series that you
   can find – !!HERE!!

   So, in no particular order:

The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie:

   61lweJbloTL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61X+YSGNaAL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
   61sxN4Ic4UL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_
    1. The Blade Itself (2006).
    2. Before They Are Hanged (2007).
    3. Last Argument of Kings (2008).

   Well, we have to start with The First Law trilogy by Lord Grimdark
   himself Mr Joe Abercrombie. Complex, morally flawed and highly
   memorable characters, great storytelling, droll and sardonic humour, a
   gritty and grim world that feels real and lived in, fast-paced and
   action-packed. This is the quintessential Grimdark trilogy for fans and
   a must-read! After a long break away from reading The Blade Itself was
   one of the first grimdark books that I picked up and it, along with the
   following two books in The First Law trilogy firmly cemented my love
   for the genre. Even years later, it is a trilogy that I remember, think
   about and one day wish to re-read to relive the grim splendour found
   within the pages.

The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51nz5Doud2L._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_
   51PZPL23wsL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_
   51U3zYRIuyL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Assassin’s Apprentice (1995).
    2. Royal Assassin (1996).
    3. Assassin’s Quest (1997).

   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two
   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a
   must-read for every sort of fantasy fan out there. Her world-building
   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in
   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,
   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal
   companion ever in fantasy, though to just call him a companion is
   detrimental to his character and role in the story. Then there is the
   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation
   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to
   Chade, another top character. And, you also have Regal Farseer, every
   trilogy/series needs a villain (think Joffrey in Game of Thrones) and
   Regal is that villain, you will hate him by the end and will be praying
   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first
   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every
   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her
   Soldier Son trilogy. Classic fantasy for everyone, great story, great
   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!

    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   61XhMlacoNL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_
   51CUYCP-fML._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

   51dMX3PfQ+L._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Ship of Magic (1998).
    2. The Mad Ship (1999).
    3. Ship of Destiny (2000).

   Hobb’s second trilogy on my list, set after the events of The Farseer
   trilogy but in a completely different area of The Six Duchies (huge
   world). This is a trilogy about talking ships or as they are called
   Live Ships! Yes, I’m sure there are some of you out there snickering
   and guffawing at the thought of sentient talking ships and I fully
   admit that I was one of you. After finishing The Farseer trilogy (I
   read all three trilogies straight after each other) I had every
   intention of missing this one out and jumping straight into The Tawny
   Man trilogy to get back to Fitz’s story, however someone I know had
   been reading Hobb to and they told me that this series was worth a
   look. Well, they were right! While completely different to both The
   Farseer trilogy (set before) and The Tawny Man trilogy (set after) this
   is a stunning read. Hobb again manages to create another completely
   different set of characters with another great story and for those who
   have read The Farseer trilogy before, well you will get more out of
   this trilogy with a certain character and that’s all I’m saying! 🙂 And
   if the idea of talking ships seems odd to you, from someone who felt
   the same, give it a go, you won’t regret it and yes, Hobb makes you
   care about the ships, I know, you find yourself caring for the fates of
   ships, crazy right! 🙂

    The Tawny Man Trilogy by Robin Hobb:

   51Lb-8IAT6L._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_
   618Q1i+cNcL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_

   61h3eaLsfqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. Fool’s Errand (2001).
    2. The Golden Fool (2002).
    3. Fool’s Fate (2003).

   OK, this is the last time that Hobb appears on my list, so relax, the
   Hobb lovefest is over, though if you have ever read any of her books
   you will see why I rate her work so highly! The Tawny Man trilogy takes
   place fifteen years after the end of The Farseer trilogy and we are
   once again reunited with our old friends, Fitz, Fool/Lord Golden (I
   wonder what he was up to during the gap between trilogies), Chade,
   Nighteyes and many more. This is a great continuation of the characters
   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in
   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,
   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking
   scene/section in literature, not just in fantasy but in all genres of
   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke
   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly
   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.

    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51opFiXXwyL
   51FZN+6rntL

   51qx9rFrwYL

    1. Prince of Thorns (2011).
    2. King of Thorns (2012).
    3. Emperor of Thorns (2013).

   Can I just write Jorg Ancrath and leave it at that?!?!?!? No, you say,
   fair enough, here is my quick overview of this trilogy !!HERE!! Love
   this series, pure Grimdark with a dark and psychotic main character in
   Jorg who won’t be to everyone’s taste but…..if you allow him, then the
   murdering little blood spilling psychopathic degenerate will captivate
   you and you find yourself pulled into his story.

    Red Queen’s War Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:

   51cXPqr31hL
   51aOLwOHC0L

   513OUovluML

    1. Prince of Fools (2014).
    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).
    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).

   After I started reading again and got into fantasy Mark Lawrence’s
   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I
   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had
   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his
   second trilogy with The Red Queen’s War, again set in his Broken Empire
   world, the story takes place during the same time frame as The Broken
   Empire and you may even see a little appearance by everyone’s favourite
   little psychopath Jorg in the books to. Focusing on two main characters
   Jalan Kendeth and Snorri ver Snagason, Jalan is a coward and a
   womaniser while Snorri is his complete opposite, honourable and
   courageous, Snorri will face danger head-on with a smile and Jalan will
   run away whilst screaming like a girl. The story throughout the three
   books in the trilogy is great and the banter and interplay between the
   two leads is top quality, emotion and humour of the highest level. Both
   Jalan and Snorri grow so much during the trilogy, that at the end, yes,
   they are both still recognisable as the characters you met pages ago at
   the beginning of Prince of Fools (Book 1) but they have developed so
   much and traits from each other have rubbed off on them both, Snorri is
   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about
   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to
   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy
   and is a must-read for fantasy fans with a captivating duo of great
   lead characters.

   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review
   for the final book The Wheel of Osheim can be found !!HERE!!

    Steelhaven Trilogy by Richard Ford:

   51+vq6cMRjL
   51+7jWisIjL

   51EAm2NHnoL

    1. Herald of the Storm (2013).
    2. The Shattered Crown (2014).
    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).

   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an
   underrated gem of a trilogy. I don’t see it around much on many fantasy
   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well
   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you
   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the
   trilogy can be found in my review !!HERE!!

    Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne by Brian Staveley:

   51-Fbaa8B-L
   51G5AzRGscL

   51Yuk3d91WL

    1. The Emperor’s Blades (2014).
    2. The Providence of Fire (2015).
    3. The Last Mortal Bond (2016).

   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main
   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,
   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in
   a fantasy list! 🙂 Great character development throughout from a trio of
   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed
   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t
   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy
   trilogy.

    Raven’s Shadow Trilogy by Anthony Ryan:

   51laqAOjePL
   51NOlkO3vOL

   51+REfw-2YL

    1. Blood Song (2011).
    2. Tower Lord (2014).
    3. Queen of Fire (2015).

   This was a hard one as to whether to even include it on the list or not
   as I’m a massive fan of the first book but felt that the second book
   was a disappointment with the third and final book going some way to
   rectifying my misgivings about the second book. The first book is
   written in the same vein as Patrick Rothfuss and his Kingkiller
   Chronicles, where the main character Vaelin Al Sorna recounts his tale
   to another. However, by the end of the book, this has changed as
   Vaelin’s tale reaches the present and we go from him recounting his
   past story to what is currently happening. I fully admit that when I
   started the series I thought great, it sounds really good and Blood
   Song is an amazing book, great characters, friendships and detailed
   world-building all created a complex story but…..

   When I started the first book I thought that I was going to be reading
   another KingKiller Chronicles and following Vaelin through his story
   for the three books or at least up until about halfway through the
   third book but that wasn’t the case. In the sequels Vaelin doesn’t play
   as large of a role in the two books and we go from having one main
   character point of view to multiple points of view and as you can see,
   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be
   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.
   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great
   book and a must-read for fantasy fans and on a whole, the trilogy is a
   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with
   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.

    The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien:

   41W+RH8kJgL
   41Pi4QuXuSL

   41fHC5yiRgL

    1. The Fellowship of the Ring (1954).
    2. The Two Towers (1954).
    3. The Return of the King (1955).

   Well, it’s the Granddaddy of all fantasy trilogies!!!! The old-timer
   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am
   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name
   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The
   Lord of The Rings?? Hands in the air?? Nope, didn’t think so! Good!
   It’s a literary classic and a trilogy everyone should read!

    The Grim Company by Luke Scull:

   51D0X03uA0L._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_
   51KH8nTmbRL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_

   5129hDWI0LL._SX315_BO1,204,203,200_

    1. The Grim Company (2013).
    2. Sword Of The North (2014).
    3. Dead Man’s Steel (2016).

   The Grim Company trilogy features an eclectic mix of characters you
   grow to care about throughout the course of the three books, an
   interesting and gritty setting, an entertaining story with twists and
   turns, emotion, dark humour and in addition to those, one of my
   favourite staples of the most wonderful genre that is grimdark,
   plentiful amounts of bloodthirsty and limb severing visceral action.

   I’m a big fan of the old and grizzled duo of the legendary highland
   warrior Brodar Kayne and Jerek the Wolf who are two of my favourite
   characters. Brodar Kayne, once known as ‘the Sword of the North‘ was
   the greatest swordsman in the North but age and time have caught up
   with him though he is still a formidable adversary and highly skilled
   with a blade. He is more calm and measured and someone who offers words
   of wisdom. While Jerek is angry, blunt, coarse and foul-mouthed with a
   gruff, surly and bad-tempered countenance. He is someone whose
   demeanour belies the depth to him as a character. Jerek often has many
   fucks to give and they are usually accompanied by the bloody blades of
   his twin axes.

   It firmly stands on its own but if you are a fan of the works of
   Abercrombie then you’ll enjoy The Grim Company.

    2. Blood of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. King of Assassins (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!

   The Wounded Kingdom is set in the Tired Lands and told in the
   first-person perspective and narrated by the assassin Girton Club-Foot.

   A span of years separates each book. At the beginning of Age of
   Assassins Girton is a fifteen-year-old and all the trials and
   tribulations that are associated with coming-of-age and when we get to
   King of Assassins the concluding volume of the trilogy Girton is
   thirty-five years of age and world-weary. Time, events and life change
   him over the course of the trilogy but even with those changes he is
   still recognisable as the Girton from the beginning and he is a
   character that you can really get behind, care about and root for.

   Though The Wounded Kingdom is very much Girton’s story there are many
   fantastic other characters included too. To name a few, Girton’s
   master, Merela Karn (they are far more than just master and apprentice,
   they have such a strong and emotional bond and the relationship between
   them is a highlight of the entire trilogy), Aydor (who goes through a
   drastic change during the trilogy and turned into one of my favourite
   characters), Rufra, Nywulf and even Xus, Girton’s Mount, C’mon, you all
   know you love animal companions in books!

   Barker doesn’t bog you down with excessive detail but with each book
   more is revealed and the world-building in The Wounded Kingdom is
   fascinating with an intriguing magic system that is well incorporated
   into both the story and the world.

   There’s plenty of action in the trilogy (a couple of large battles, one
   in the second book, Blood of Assassins is phenomenal and another
   highlight of the trilogy but most of the action is small-scale battles
   and duels involving Girton which often have a beauty and a poetry to
   them as Girton dances going through a series of iterations when he
   fights) but it’s not the main focus and whilst there is plenty to
   satisfy any cravings that you might have what action there is, is
   included alongside character development, intrigue and storytelling to
   create an absorbing read for each book in the trilogy.

   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each
   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review
   of King of Assassins, I dubbed it as ‘thrilling fantasy‘ as it’s a
   perfect blending together of the two genres.

   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you
   still don’t know how Barker will conclude his trilogy and with a low
   page count left the story could still go in any number of different
   directions. Yet still, Barker manages to knock you for six ending with
   a shocking revelation that will make you sit back and reflect on many
   events that happened over all three of the books and it is a perfect
   conclusion, thought-provoking and surprising with a poignant epilogue
   too.

   With each book Barker upped the ante and improved, Age of Assassins was
   a great debut, Blood of Assassins was a better book and then King of
   Assassins was even better, the best of the three and nigh on
   perfection.

   The Wounded Kingdom trilogy is a journey that is well worth your time
   and Girton is a character that you will love.

    2. The Tower of Living and Dying (2018) – find my review !!HERE!!
    3. The House of Sacrifice (2019) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Throughout the Empires of Dust trilogy, you follow Marith Altrersyr,
   King Ruin, King Death and Amrath Returned on his journey, his merry
   dance of conquest, death, destruction and massacre across Irlast. From
   a nobody in a mercenary crew marching on Sorlost in The Court of Broken
   Knives to the King of Irlast in The House of Sacrifice. We see him
   descend into madness, see him kill, destroy, raze cities to the ground
   and bathe the world in rivers of blood. His empire is been built from
   the death, the blood, the bones, the corpses, the decaying remains and
   the rotting flesh of his enemies, from those who stand against him,
   turned to dust in the ground.

   As well as following Marith, the story also takes place in Sorlost, the
   crown jewel of the Sekemleth Empire. Sorlost is like an aged movie star
   whose beauty has long since faded and whose glory days lay far behind
   them. It is a city with a storied history, a city whose bronze walls
   have never been breached but it is no longer gloriously golden.
   Instead, it is a gilded turd, mired in filth, decaying, rotting,
   wilting and withering away.

   In Sorlost we follow Orhan Emmereth and the machinations, various
   plans, plots, politicking and scheming that he undertakes throughout
   the trilogy along with witnessing the fallout of his deceptions and
   lies.

   There are a few of other PoV characters in the trilogy but to avoid any
   spoilers on their story arcs and events from the trilogy I’ll refrain
   from mentioning them.

   Marith is a drug addict (Hatha) and a drunk. A complicated character,
   conflicted and self-destructive. He is full of loathing and self-pity
   he hates himself and what he does but, at the same time, he likes doing
   what he does too, it gives him a sense of being, of purpose and like a
   coin he has two sides, two sides to his nature that war with each
   other. Along with moments of clarity, of lucidity, he spirals down into
   the throes of insanity and his fractured mind is a turbulent and
   churning sea. He’s captivating and he’s someone that you love to hate.

   The Empires of Dust is populated by characters with hardly any morals
   or redeeming features. To give you an idea about him I’ve mentioned
   Marith in detail but honestly, I enjoyed reading about all the
   characters involved in the story that Smith Spark weaves over the three
   books.

   The fighting in the Empires of Dust trilogy is plentiful, confusing and
   chaotic, violent, vivid and visceral.

   The world-building is stellar and throughout the course of the trilogy
   the world opens up like a flower coming into bloom and Smith Sparks
   brings all of the locations to life thanks to her decadently
   descriptive writing. It is the small details that just add that little
   extra clarity, that makes the image, the location, the setting and the
   scene more evocative and more graphic.

   Smith Spark has a very unique way of writing and writes with a mixture
   of richly detailed sentences that gently caress you with her words and
   short and snappy sentences that are sharp, harsh and like a bark. She
   often uses only a single word or a variety of words that all hold a
   similar meaning to convey emotion with both third-person perspective
   and first-person perspective thrown into the mix too.

   There is a beauty and a cadence to be found in Smith Spark’s lilting
   and lyrical writing. Her writing flows smoothly like blood from a
   freshly opened wound, like waves lapping on the shore and like leaves
   rustling on a gentle breeze. The mixture of sentences that are used to
   beat, bludgeon and pummel. Like chewing on broken glass, rusted nails
   and thorns. Then, the contrast, the counterpoint and those sentences
   that gently caress you, like a lovers hands, their soft touch, their
   warm embrace. Like soothing your mouth with the sweetest honey and
   quenching your thirst with a glass of ice-cold water.

   The Empires of Dust is the epitome of the beauty that can be found in
   darkness and grimdark at its finest. It is a tapestry of betrayal,
   blood, brutality, butchery, conquest, corpses, death, delusion,
   desires, destruction, killing, love, mania, machinations, pain,
   regrets, plots, politics, suffering, tragedy and violence.

    Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne.

    3. A Time of Courage (2020) – find my review !!HERE!!

   Taking place nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years after the Day of Wrath
   and the end The Faithful and the Fallen series (my all-time favourite
   fantasy series) the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a stand-alone,
   self-contained and it firmly stands on its own as an outstanding
   trilogy. If you will, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is a companion
   piece to The Faithful and the Fallen with the two mixing together like
   blood on a battlefield and telling a complete story.

   The Of Blood and Bone trilogy sees the continuation of the endless war
   between the Ben-Elim and the Kadoshim. On the surface it is a story
   about good vs evil but, it is so much more and there is a depth to the
   story and to the characters involved that transcends ‘good vs evil‘ and
   makes the story so much more.

   There is plenty of bloody, brutal, heart-pounding and visceral action
   in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy against a variety of foes and horrific
   fell creatures. The fight scenes are first-class, plentiful and written
   by Gwynne in stellar fashion and all engagement shave a heft to them, a
   weight to them that makes for edge-of-your-seat and exciting reading.
   Some are small scale and more personal with old scores to be settled
   whilst others are huge in scope with blockbuster sequences that are
   cinematic and consist of thousands of combatants upon the field. You
   easily picture yourself in the thick of the action, you feel the
   bone-crunching and jarring blows, the shouting of war cries, the
   screams of anguish and pain, the clash of swords, the thrum of
   bowstrings and the ground shaking with the impact and the wounds
   inflicted. You are there, not reading but, fighting alongside,
   transported, living and breathing the many battles.

   Throughout your time spent reading the Of Blood and Bone trilogy, you
   will laugh, you will cry and you will care. You will go through a range
   of emotions from soaring highs to sorrowful lows. There will be moments
   where you fist-pump the air in joy and in relief. There are plentiful
   moments of dread and of fear for the fate of the characters where you
   curse Gwynne for the seemingly unending torment, torture and hell that
   he puts the characters through. As they struggle to endure, to survive
   against the odds and the overwhelming forces of evil and as they barely
   hang on against Asroth, the Kadoshim and the tides of darkness.

   There are the past and the present in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy
   with bygone names and events mentioned in revered tones. Legends that
   echo, that reverberate, that are laced with meaning and that, if you
   have read The Faithful and the Fallen series will have you nodding,
   smiling away at yourself and whispering the immortal battle cry of
   ‘Truth and Courage‘. When you come to the end of A Time of Courage, the
   third and final book in the Of Blood and Bone trilogy new names will
   have been made, new legends will have been forged, risen to stand
   beside those of the past and who now have their own legend carved,
   etched and forever immortalised in the history of the Banished Lands.

   Gwynne isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty, bloody his axe, cleave
   bone, tear flesh and characters will die. During the trilogy, the
   characters endure many hardships and are put through the wringer time
   and time again. Will your favourites fall? Will they make it to the
   end? It’s not for me to say but, you are invested and eyes will water.
   You will mourn for the fallen and you will cheer for the living.

   There’s a strength to Gwynne’s writing and a conviction that flows
   through his words as he concludes his powerfully told tale of good vs
   evil and he is a phenomenal storyteller. The story unfolds through
   multiple perspectives and the writing is descriptive, meaningful,
   emotive and often profound with weighted words and passages that are
   heavy with meaning. The characters all develop and grow throughout from
   the first few pages of A Time of Dread to the end of A Time o Courage
   they continue to develop. Gwynne doesn’t just give you ‘characters’ on
   a page, he gives you real people to root for, to cheer and the reverse,
   to hate and to vilify. There are many big loud and bombastic moments
   along with the intense action and ferocious fighting that takes place
   but, there is also plenty of room left for contemplation, for
   introspection, for quiet, retrospective and thoughtful moments too
   spread throughout the entire trilogy. There is also light to be found
   in the darkness with the banter and camaraderie that occurs between the
   characters. One thing with Gwynne, he writes animals so well, they
   aren’t companions to the characters, they are characters in their own
   right and in the story, they are more, they are friend and warrior too.

   Regardless of whether or not you have read The Faithful and the Fallen
   series you will still find a lot to like about the Of Blood and Bone
   trilogy…A LOT! For me, personally. I would say that I highly recommend
   reading The Faithful and the Fallen series first for the knowledge,
   added depth, shading to the world and the emotional impact that the
   names and events mentioned will have on you heightening your reading
   experience and elevating it to another richer level. If, however you do
   decide to dive straight into the Of Blood and Bone trilogy then I am
   that sure you will love it and I wish you many happy hours reading what
   is an incredible journey that Gwynne will take you on.

   For fantasy fans, Gwynne is a must-read author and a name that should
   be first on the lips of everyone when recommending a fantasy
   series/trilogy to another fantasy fan or, a reader looking to try
   fantasy.

   Simply, the Of Blood and Bone trilogy is stunning and a masterpiece.

       I just finished up the Farseer trilogy earlier this year. It took
       me til book 3 to understand why everyone loves that series so much.
       I’m going to have to continue on with more Hobb.
       Nice list!

       Okay so my brother is obsessed with Robin Hobb so the Live Ship
       traders have been on my radar for a long time, but this has really
       convinced me to bump her up the list! I actually think live ships
       is such a cool idea, I’m kicking myself that I didn’t think of it
       first!
       I’ve got Prince Of Thorns on my bedside TBR because I do like
       grimdark, but I’m a bit nervous to begin it because of the
       reputation of just HOW dark Jorg is, as you say… I love fantasy
       characters who are rampant murderers (not sure what this says about
       me haha) but I can’t abide sexual violence against women in books
       because it strikes a little too close to the bone of real life
       society.

            Jorg definitely is a crazy little psycho but such a fantastic
            character too.
            Liveship’s is a fantastic idea. It sounds crazy ,absolutely
            crazy and I scoffed at reading it but damn, you care about
            ships which sounds crazy but it is so good. Definitely best to
            read Hobb in order though due to extra little bits you get in
            the books as the trilogies are all linked and take place in
            the same world.👍📚

                 You should give Sanderson a try. He is in my opinion the
                 best writer there is! Give him another try! Mistborn is
                 amazing and gets better in the second and third books.
                 Stormlight archive and elantris are awesome too!

       I have a suggestion for you.. Try the Broken Earth trilogy by N. K.
       Jemisin..
       It’s very different from the books on your list ( which are all
       excellent, btw) but it has everything we expect from fantasy

       I’ve been planning to read the Liveship series. It’s been about
       five years since I read Farseer, and I remembered absolutely loving
       it, but wanted to do a re-read before returning to the Six Duchies.
       I’ve been doing an audio re-read, and can’t recommend this series
       enough. It’s fantastic. Also, there are two further series in the
       “Realm of the Elderlings” beyond the Tawny Man series. Have you
       read them? If so, any comments?
       Secondly, I can only take so much grimdark. Any other
       recommendations that are a bit more light-hearted (not comedy, and
       not all the heroes have to survive, but I’d like something that
       doesn’t depress me quite as much as grimdark)?

            I’ve read The Rainwild Chronicles series by Hobb. I’d have
            perhaps included it in the list but it’s not a trilogy and
            whilst enjoyable and good it wasn’t as good, for me, as
            Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man. It ties in with them all
            though and is enjoyable and is also less dark too.
            I haven’t read the other trilogy completely yet. The first
            book is decent but slow and the second one is fantastic but
            once I read the third it’s over so I’ve been putting it off.
            I can’t think of any other trilogies. Sorry, there’s lots out
            there but I tend towards the darker grimdark stuff and only
            started reading fantasy in 2011 and I’m a slow reader too so
            miss out on many myself.

                 Thanks,
                 It’s not that I completely avoid grimdark; it’s just that
                 I’d appreciate good series that are not so focused on
                 showing the darker sides of humanity.
                 Thanks for the comments on the further Elderling series.
                 After I finish my reread, I’ll be moving into the
                 Liveship series, but probably won’t get to Tawny man for
                 a few years anyway. This list gives me some other
                 alternatives, as well. They are appreciated.

       Some amazing selections a d most I haven’t read before. I
       definitely agree with lord of the rings.
       I really like this idea for trilogies as there are so many great
       ones.

                 I just returned to the Realm of the Elderlings recently,
                 and am 2/3rds through Liveship Traders. It really is
                 wonderful. And it’s not really about “talking ships” any
                 more than the Two Towers is about “talking trees”. They
                 are a significant part of the story, but have a great
                 (and tragic) story behind them, just as the Ents do.

       Hahahaha…. the first 9 and the last series is everything on my TBR…
       stop living in my head. The funny thing, randomly, is that up until
       like a month ago, I had no idea who Mark Lawrence was. A internet
       friend of mine who loves him (we’ve talked since my days of
       blogging hockey) and was bemoaning the ending of his last series
       and mentioned the start of his next series. So I went on Edelweiss
       to see if I could get him information on when it would start and
       the name. I noticed the imprint putting it out and emailed them and
       they said they’d send me a copy when it was available. Kevin
       flipped his lid. Because apparently this guy is like mega huge. I
       didn’t know lol. I just figured I’d ask? Anyhow that is my
       completely long winded story of how I found out about Mark Lawrence
       and apparently have been listed for a coveted ARC that I didn’t
       know about.

            Awesome! I haven’t read the last two books in his latest
            series yet but, I know his new one is set on the same world
            but years in the future and isn’t out until April (I think)
            next year, nice one! That was a stroke of luck, good for you

       Glad you included Robin Hobb’s trilogy of trilogies, as they’re
       really not complete on their own. 🙂
       Nice to see Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne there, it doesn’t get
       nearly the love it deserves.

            Of course, all three are brilliant and all tie in together.👍
            I’d probably have her other trilogy on the list too but I’ve
            never gotten around to reading the final book.

                 OopS! My bad. Got series stuck in my mind. I do recommend
                 the two trilogies though. I’m looking forward to starting
                 Broken Empire soon and have another book by R.J. Barker,
                 which I’m hoping will turn out better than some reviews
                 I’ve seen.

                 Ah, do you mean The Bone Ships? I absolutely loved it and
                 many others did too but yeah, some middling reviews for
                 it around too.

            I’m not a Sanderson fan, I read and enjoyed the first Mistborn
            book, but never felt the want or need to carry on with the
            series and I haven’t read any of his other stuff either.

       I’m so glad I came upon this post. Was in despair at having nothing
       interesting to read. But have started Prince of Thorns and am
       hooked even as I’m shocked at what a 13-year-old boy can do, think
       or feel! Think I’m going to enjoy this series. And it’s long – yay!
       Looking forward to reading all the books.
