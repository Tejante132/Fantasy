   Whether you’ve sat around waiting for your Hogwarts letter or looked
   for Narnia in the back of a closet, you've probably dreamt of stepping
   into your favorite fantasy books and leaving the real world behind. But
   the genre isn’t all witches, wardrobes, and whimsy! Beyond offering
   temporary escape from the pressures of daily life, the best fantasy
   books help us confront them.

   Stories of the otherworldly allow readers to make sense of this world,
   refracting change, wickedness, and heartache through a magical lens so
   we can see them all more clearly — and face them head-on. A good
   fantasy book illuminates the mind with childlike wonder, but also
   lingers in our memories because of its connection to real life.

   In other words, great fantasy books show us the world in another guise,
   yet each is also a universe unto itself. We hope you enjoy exploring
   them in this list of the best fantasy books of all time!

   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition)

1. Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (1865)

   Even if you’re not a math geek, you’re probably familiar with the
   algebraist Charles Dodgson — you just know him his much more famous
   alter-ego, Lewis Carroll. Unlike Dodgson, Carroll wrote stories that
   defied logic, twisting it into dreamlike, fantastical shapes: a
   hookah-smoking caterpillar, a flamingo-filled croquet-ground, a
   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in
   Wonderland, which has delighted adults and children alike since it was
   published over a century and a half ago — and today is recognized as a
   momentous early foray into the fantasy genre as a whole.

   The King of Elfland's Daughter

   The King of Elfland’s Daughter is a fairy tale with deep, dark roots —
   as well as a love story rendered with piercing emotional honesty. It’s
   also an unlikely immigration novel, about an elfin princess’s attempts
   to deal with her fractured sense of self as she adjusts to the homeland
   of her beloved human husband. Another remarkably early entry into the
   fantasy genre, this book prompted Arthur C. Clarke to name Dunsany as
   one of the greatest writers of his century, and World Fantasy Award
   winner Jane Yolen to call him “the great grandfather of us all.”

   It might be a childhood favorite, but The Hobbit gives adult fantasy
   readers one of the genre’s most relatable protagonists: a middle-aged
   homebody who just wants to chill. The iconic Bilbo Baggins speaks to
   all grownup introverts who like nothing more than a good meal and a
   cozy chair. But we all hope we’d find Bilbo-like reservoirs of heroism
   within us — yes, while a career as a Chosen One might be out of reach
   for us, we can all aspire to be Bilbo Baggins.

   Sword in the Stone (Essential Modern Classics)

   We all know what happens after King Arthur pulls the sword out of the
   stone; The Sword in the Stone takes a look at the before. Predictably,
   it’s much less glamorous. In this telling, the archetypical fantasy
   monarch was once just a boy called Wart — teased by his foster-brother
   Kay and subjected to a punishing round of lessons that would make any
   modern high-schooler wince in sympathy. Only Wart’s education doesn’t
   involve AP Calculus and JV Track... and his teacher, Merlyn, prefers to
   instruct by turning his students into animals instead of grilling them
   with the Socratic method.

   When the four Pevensie siblings leave bomb-ravaged London to wait out
   World War II in the countryside, they discover a portal to the magical
   land of Narnia behind a pile of fur coats. But their magical new
   vacation spot suffers from bad leadership: it’s governed by a witch
   whose only policy decisions are about ensuring eternal winter with no
   Christmas cheer. The Pevensies have to oust her — with the help of a
   talking lion! If you’re a fantasy buff, you’ll already know that the
   lion is a Christological stand-in, and that The Lion, the Witch, and
   the Wardrobe is a meditation on redemption, sacrifice, and faith. But
   you don’t need to worship anything to want to drop in on Narnia for an
   hour or two.

   Like the first five books on this list, The Master and Margarita is
   often considered one of the 20th century’s finest novels. Unlike them,
   it’s definitely not for kids. Written at the height of Stalinist
   repression, it braids together two narrative strands: one a
   psychologically subtle take on the death of Christ, the other a
   devilish satire on Soviet intellectual life. And where does the
   mysterious Muscovian author, known only as the Master, fall in all of
   this? In reality, fearful of political repression, Mikhail Bulgakov fed
   his first attempt at this story to the flames; fortunately for
   Russophiles and demonologists everywhere, he gave it another try.

   The Last Unicorn

   With its shimmering, lilac-scented prose, The Last Unicorn treads the
   line between novel and poetry — reading with the ease of a bedtime
   story and the depth of an allegory. In this gossamer world, we meet an
   immortal Unicorn, who’s grieved to learn from a hunting party that she
   might be the last of her kind. Upon leaving her enchanted forest to
   investigate their claims, she finds that humans perceive her as an
   ordinary white horse. The Unicorn’s wanderings put her in the company
   of ringmasters and harpies, magicians and kings: some who want to harm
   her, and some who do their best to help.

   On a dense cluster of islands, inhabited by dragons and raised out of
   the water by a god, master fantasist Ursula K. Le Guin spins out
   elegant, character-driven tales, enriched by her knowledge of world
   mythology. Her first installment in the Earthsea series, A Wizard of
   Earthsea, is a bildungsroman of the old school, albeit enlivened with
   wizardry: a magical coming-of-age that treats hefty themes like death,
   the environment, and cosmic balance — all with Le Guin’s
   characteristically deft touch.

   The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the
   Rings

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than
   any other work — and this is the volume that started it off. Like The
   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   Watership Down: A Novel (Puffin Books Book 1)

10. Watership Down by Richard Adams (1972)

   Buy on Amazon
   (BUTTON) Add to library

   If you don’t think a rabbit warren could be reasonably described as
   epic fantasy, clearly you’ve never read Watership Down. This stirring
   adventure story has it all: warriors and visions, harrowing escapes and
   heartbreaking deaths — its stars just happen to be unusually soft of
   fur and long of ear. Indeed, when human encroachment on their
   environment threatens their way of life, the rabbits react the way any
   self-respecting group of noble warriors would: by going on a quest.
   Despite its adorable premise, Richard Adams’ novel draws on a rich
   wellspring of literary precedents, and reads like Beowulf by way of
   Beatrix Potter.

   The Dark is Rising (The Dark is Rising Sequence)

11. The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper (1973)

   Buy on Amazon
   (BUTTON) Add to library

   A perennial favorite of both elementary schoolers and their teachers,
   The Dark is Rising renders the cosmic conflict between Light and Dark
   in lively style, at a scale accessible to young readers. It centers on
   British schoolboy Will Stanton, who discovers, on his eleventh
   birthday, that he’s actually an immortal Light warrior known as an Old
   One — bound to play out an eternal struggle against the forces of the
   Dark. This story is perfectly contextualized by Susan Cooper's vast
   mythological knowledge, drawing generously from the sea-scented myths
   of her native British Isles, especially the Arthurian legend.

   Adventure

12. The Princess Bride by William Goldman (1973)

   Besides its iconic adaptation, Goldman’s novel is most famous for its
   delightfully complicated framework: the core story deals with a farm
   boy called Westley, a gentrywoman named Buttercup, and the many
   colorful — and hilarious — obstacles that impede their love. According
   to The Princess Bride's extensive (fictional) footnotes, this
   picaresque romance was drawn from Goldman’s favorite childhood tale,
   which his father had always read aloud. Years later, when he finally
   read it for himself, he found out that Goldman Sr. strayed pretty
   liberally from the text... but the heartwarming adventure story that
   resulted as all the better for it.

   With its elegant language and a thoughtfully rendered heroine, The
   Forgotten Beasts of Eld has won the love of readers young and old (not
   to mention the 197 World Fantasy Award). The story centers on teenage
   orphan Sybel, whose only companions are the sentient, mythical
   creatures who share her mountain home — and with whom she cohabits
   happily. But one day, a stranger named Coren arrives, along with a
   newborn he claims to be the rightful heir to the kingdom of Eld.
   Together, the man and the baby conscript Sybel into single parenthood —
   and drag her quiet mountain refuge into a world of political turmoil.

   A Midsummer Tempest

   Poul Anderson is better known for his science fiction, but this slim,
   strange, and utterly engrossing book demonstrates his range as a
   storyteller. A Midsummer Tempest takes place in an alternate version of
   17th century — one where everything Shakespeare wrote actually happened
   and fairies were very much real. Inventive as the premise sounds, this
   one’s really quite faithful as far as Shakespearean fanfic goes: all
   the noble characters speak in iambic pentameter, as if they were
   written by the Bard himself.

   The first installment in the 10-book Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,
   Lord Foul’s Bane starts off in a decidedly un-Tolkien-esque fashion:
   with a protagonist who’s American, a novelist, and newly recovered from
   leprosy, a disease to which he lost two fingers. And as far as his new
   neighbors are concerned, the titular Thomas, with his two missing
   fingers, is a dead ringer for their culture-hero, Berek Halfhand — a
   misunderstanding that kicks off this complicated and morally grey giant
   of the genre.

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust
   Pacific Northwest, in which the surviving humans have diverged into
   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science
   fiction framework” — a designation that effectively encompasses the
   thematic complexity of the book. The author herself, however, called
   Kindred “a kind of grim fantasy.” Indeed, its time-traveling
   protagonist, a young black woman named Dana, finds herself flickering
   between 1976 Los Angeles and 1815 Maryland. In the antebellum South,
   she winds up in the company of her own ancestors — an enslaved woman
   named Alice and a slave-owner named Rufus. Butler’s spare prose and
   mastery of psychological detail render the human cost of slavery with
   devastating clarity.

   Like fellow multimedia phenomenon The Princess Bride, The Neverending
   Story uses a framework narrative to reflect on the power of, well,
   stories. The title refers to a book within the book: an antique volume
   unearthed by a boy called Bastian, an outsider at odds with schoolyard
   bullies and a distant father. As he reads — with us peering over his
   shoulder — Bastian is literally pulled into the story of Fantastica, a
   magical realm ruled by an immortal Childlike Empress. But the empress
   is dying, and without her power, Fantastica and all its people will
   disappear. It’s up to reader-turned-protagonist Bastian to save her.

   Little, Big is the perfect fantasy novel for people who don’t like
   fantasy. It reads like a prestigious generational saga, the kind of
   thing you’d find in English dissertations and on Booker Prize
   shortlists — just with a few fairies thrown into the mix. No wonder
   literary critic Harold Bloom, notorious for thumbing his nose at the
   likes of Harry Potter, praised it as a “neglected masterpiece.” At its
   center is the Drinkwater family, whose architect patriarch built their
   sprawling family estate in the hazy borderlands between the Faerie

   their lives.

   Stephen King is best known for infiltrating our nightmares with
   stalkers and murderous clowns. But The Gunslinger proves he’s got a
   gift for fantasy too — just don’t expect it to be light and fluffy!
   This novel pulls from a broad palette of influences, from cowboy
   westerns to the poetry of Robert Browning. The hero, Roland of Gilead,
   wields his gun in pursuit of a shadowy Man in Black who's as dangerous
   as he is mysterious, with the power to spawn demons and raise the dead.
   Luckily or not, Roland's not alone in his pursuit; he finds a traveling
   companion in Jake Chambers, a schoolboy from our world.

   Beloved fantasy writer Terry Pratchett made his name on tales from
   Discworld: a flat, circular planet, carried on the backs of four
   elephants balanced on a turtle. The 41-book series is a world unto its
   own — and it all began with The Color of Magic. Pratchett conceived the
   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that
   saturated the market at the time. The result is playful-yet-thoughtful
   story about an incompetent wizard and a ignorant tourist, whose
   adventure reads like a hilarious, sparkling travelogue.

   The most influential reimagining of the Arthurian legend since The
   Sword and the Stone, this sharply observed novel turns a feminist gaze
   on age-old tales. The Mists of Avalon centers on Arthur’s sorcerous
   half-sister Morgaine — better known as Morgan le Fay. A pagan priestess
   of Avalon blessed with clairvoyance, she’s troubled by the encroachment
   of Christian missionaries into the land she loves. Her sister-in-law
   Gwenhwyfar, meanwhile, emerges as her opposite: a devout and
   increasingly fanatical Christian. The ideological clash between them
   represents a far greater conflict, which the book unflinchingly depicts
   with all the dark tragedy of the original legend.

   In an era when “fantasy” was synonymous with “fake medieval Europe,”

   see this reimagining through the eyes of Number Ten Ox, a young man
   those village is ravaged by a mysterious plague that destroys silkworms
   and renders its children unconscious. He finds aid in Master Li Kao, a

   Celebrated for its dazzling prose, Mythago Wood is as densely

   and you'll discover its inhabitants — myth-images, or mythagos, who
   have come out of ancestral memory and the story-seeped subconscious of
   the human mind. These might be monsters, centaurs, or several different
   versions of King Arthur. We explore Ryhope Wood with the Huxley

   with measured skepticism, even as his brother Christian starts to lose

   The end of the world has never been so funny. Equal parts biting and

   discovering his novelistic voice. Take this dream team, add 50% more
   laughter than you think is possible, and you’ll have Good Omens. The
   book’s tween Anti-Christ, Adam, is refreshingly human and irresistibly
   likable. But its true stars are the fussy angel Aziraphale and

   Booker Prize winner The Famished Road makes an eloquent case for the
   place of magical creatures in the literary big leagues — and, in 1991,
   brought fantasy out of its traditional Anglo-American silo. Author Ben
   Okri moves fluidly between genres and influences: combining Yoruba oral
   traditions and Shakespearean allusions, mixing magical realism with
   Enlightenment philosophy. His very protagonist, Azaro, is a creature of
   the hybrid and the in-between: an abiku, or child spirit, he dwells
   between the realms of the living and the dead. But Okri manages to
   ground this unorthodox story with spare, elegant prose and devastating
   pathos.

   gritty remix of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Was uses L. Frank Baum’s
   sunny fable to examine the mundane tragedies of modern life, from child
   abuse to HIV. The main character of this tale is an orphan named
   Dorothy Gael, whose Uncle Henry abuses her with Aunty Em’s tacit

   a gay actor weakened by AIDS. Close to dying, he rallies for a final

   world is crafted by Pullman with all the deft-fingered care of a
   Renaissance painter, laying on the details stroke by stroke. Perhaps
   most excitingly, here there be daemons: externalized souls that tail
   each person in animal form. Lyra’s daemon, Pantalaimon, is one of the

   and gave its name to the show that brought TV fantasy into the
   mainstream. If His Dark Materials is the anti-Narnia, then A Game of
   Thrones and its sequels are the anti-LOTR. In a sharp-toothed reaction
   to Tolkien’s idealism, Martin gives us a quasi-medieval setting as rich
   in magic as Middle-earth, though it runs on cynical realpolitik instead
   of quiet courage. In this grimdark world, winter is coming, debts must

   A decade after Good Omens, Neil Gaiman returned to the world of
   religious fantasy with this magnificent solo venture. American Gods
   blends old legends with a modern noir sensibility — it’s peopled with
   deities and convicts, and the distinctions between them aren’t always
   clear. At its center is the improbably named Shadow Moon, a new widower
   who drifts into the employ of a con-man named Mr. Wednesday. They go on
   a good, old-fashioned American road-trip — but Shadow soon discovers
   that their cross-country trek isn’t all that it appears to be

   The Etched City’s cloak-and-dagger plot stands out thanks to a richly

   Islamic world. Following a civil war where their side lost, bounty
   hunter Gwynn and healer Raule are chased out of their homeland. As the
   pair attempt to find their footing in this Etched City, they experience
   the very human costs of exile and political turmoil. This is K.J.
   Bishops’ first and only work of book-length fiction, but it’ll make you

   Every once in a while, you encounter a voice of such talent and
   originality it stands out like a signal fire against the night. In the
   world of fantasy, Susannah Clarke is that voice. Her magnum opus,
   Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, is an alternate history of England
   during the Napoleonic Wars, combining Gothic fiction with comedy of
   manners to interrogate romantic myths of the English past. After a full
   decade in the making, it catapulted straight from Bloomsbury’s press to
   The New York Times bestseller list. The rest is history — or, should we
   say, alternate history.

   This witty, sci-fi/fantasy take on the afterlife has shades of both The
   Good Place and Black Mirror — and fittingly enough, reflects
   consistently on the notion of endings. Before his suicide, protagonist
   Ben Mendelssohn was a professional ender: a ghostwriter for authors
   unable to finish their own stories. And after putting a bullet in his
   own head, Ben emerges in the Other World: a strangely sterile afterlife
   where the shades of the dead can customize their own microclimates.
   Clearly, The World of the End was an incredibly precocious — maybe even
   prophetic — work, anticipating pop cultural themes a decade ahead of
   time.

   The Name of the Wind boasts another complicated framework narrative
   that, in this case, turns the entire work into a meditation on the
   importance of storytelling. It’s told as a fictional autobiography
   whose subject — and narrator — is the legendary culture-hero Kvothe,
   living incognito at the novel’s beginning as a humble innkeeper. But
   his cover’s blown following the appearance, in the flesh, of a demon
   long relegated to the realm of myths. Long story short — or if you read
   the whole thing, long story long — Kvothe ends up recounting the
   submerged stories of his past, from his magical education to his myriad
   heartbreaks.

   This high fantasy novel (in the guise of New Yorker-friendly lit fic)
   follows a high school senior named Quentin, who finds his way into
   magic college en route to his Princeton interview. But there are no
   sun-drenched Quidditch matches at Brakebills: instead, the curriculum
   turns on classical philology and the memorization of magical hand
   positions. Indeed, between this and its frank treatment of sexuality
   and mental health, The Magicians has often been touted as a “Harry
   Potter for grownups.” And if you’re more Ravenclaw than Gryffindor, you
   might find yourself daydreaming about Brakebills instead of Hogwarts —
   at least until Grossman deconstructs the trope of the magical boarding
   school with devastating acuity.

   China, with a version of the country called Kitai having recently
   achieved a hard-fought peace. Shen Tai, the second son of a legendary
   general, takes advantage of the ceasefire to bury the long-abandoned
   dead: both his own Kitai countrymen and their Taguran enemies, whose
   ghosts still haunt the site of their fatal defeats. In response, the
   Taguran empress gifts him a herd of 250 prized horses — making him an

   charmingly meta fashion, and has a comforting familiarity of form, as
   we see everything through Mori’s journal entries — where she vents
   about math classes, bra shopping, and first love along with the
   difficulties of spell-casting. If you’re into quirky, genre-bending
   works, you’ll definitely find Mori a charming and relatable guide to

   confection of a fantasy takes place, predictably enough, at a circus
   that’s only open at night. The mysterious carnival has been prepared as
   the dazzling battleground for a duel between two magicians, Celia and
   Marco — both raised as puppets in the rivalry between their two
   powerful mentors. But instead of giving their all to the coming battle,
   Celia and Marco have done something unforgivable: they’ve fallen in

   This wildly imaginative historical fantasy involves an unexpected pair
   of magical creatures — the titular golem and jinni, from Jewish and
   Arabic mythology respectively. The former, Chava, was brought to life
   by a wicked kabbalist to serve as a mail-order bride; the latter,
   Ahmad, lived for centuries inside a copper flask, only to end up as a
   tinsmith once freed. After a chance encounter in the 19th century,
   Chava and Ahmad become friends — swapping stories on their struggles to
   pass as human. The Golem and the Jinni draws the reader in with a

   humans whose bodies tick out the passage of time through their slow
   decay. We soon encounter two groups of immortals through a bone clock

   Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro penned this elegiac, post-Arthurian
   fantasy over the course of a difficult decade. The result was well
   worth the wait: The Guardian’s glowing review hailed it as “Game of
   Thrones with a conscience.” The Buried Giant considers the entanglement
   of old age, memory, and national history in a setting infused with the
   otherworld. At its center are an elderly couple named Axl and Beatrice,
   Briton villagers living in a world where King Arthur has died, leaving
   behind a seemingly durable peace. But everyone in Axl and Beatrice’s
   village continues to suffer: not from armed conflict, but from the
   mist, an amnesia that seems to have eaten away all their memories of a

   The Fifth Season is perhaps N.K. Jemisin's most fully realized work,
   combining her trademark psychological complexity with an
   ultra-immersive world and a magic system of startling originality. It's
   set in a Pangaea-like supercontinent called the Stillness — an ironic
   name, since the land is ravaged periodically by earthquakes. Because of
   this, the Stillness is a dangerous place for orogenes, who have the
   ability to control earthquakes and channel temperature. Called “roggas”
   and savaged by mobs because of their dangerous powers, orogenes rarely
   make it to adulthood. But those who survive — generally by hiding their
   abilities — are herded towards a training facility called the Fulcrum,
   where they suffer oppressions of their own.

   The first installment in a planned trilogy, The Grace of Kings is
   entertaining as well as erudite. It’s already become a foundational
   work of the sensibility Liu terms “silkpunk”: an East Asian-inflected
   spin on steampunk that trades in gears and goggles for bamboo and
   paper. The Grace of Kings uses this silkpunk framework to rewrite some
   of the most exciting stories from a canonical Han-dynasty text. The
   result is a page-turner even for bookworms who don’t have knowledge of
   Chinese history — and full of delightful easter eggs for those who do.

   is the new Sorcerer Royal of black African descent, and Prunella
   Gentleman is a biracial, magical finishing school drop-out. Together,
   they have to prevent an all-out war between powerful magical factions —

   select group of citizens must act as “Scythes” to determine who will
   live and die. This is the role taken on by our teenage protagonists,
   Citra and Rowan, who grapple with intense issues of mortality and
   morality as they train to be Scythes — growing more suspicious all the

   Even if you’re not a math geek, you’re probably familiar with the

   hookah-smoking caterpillar, a flamingo-filled croquet-ground, a
   perpetually tardy White Rabbit. The result was Alice's Adventures in

   devilish satire on Soviet intellectual life. And where does the
   mysterious Muscovian author, known only as the Master, fall in all of

   The Lord of the Rings has made its mark on high fantasy’s DNA more than

   Hobbit, its prequel of sorts, The Fellowship of the Ring is a story
   that turns on ordinary acts of courage. Running as a counterpoint
   alongside the thundering motifs of kingly destiny and good-versus-evil,
   we see the innocent bravery of country gentlemen and the loyalty of
   gardeners. These, the book argues, are the real engines of historical
   change. And in today's fantasy landscape overshadowed by the grimdark,
   returning to Tolkien’s brand of clear-eyed hope can be a real breath of
   fresh air.

   self-respecting group of noble warriors would: by going on a quest.
   Despite its adorable premise, Richard Adams’ novel draws on a rich

   delightfully complicated framework: the core story deals with a farm
   boy called Westley, a gentrywoman named Buttercup, and the many
   colorful — and hilarious — obstacles that impede their love. According
   to The Princess Bride's extensive (fictional) footnotes, this
   picaresque romance was drawn from Goldman’s favorite childhood tale,
   which his father had always read aloud. Years later, when he finally
   read it for himself, he found out that Goldman Sr. strayed pretty
   liberally from the text... but the heartwarming adventure story that
   resulted as all the better for it.

   With its elegant language and a thoughtfully rendered heroine, The

   orphan Sybel, whose only companions are the sentient, mythical
   creatures who share her mountain home — and with whom she cohabits
   happily. But one day, a stranger named Coren arrives, along with a

   Together, the man and the baby conscript Sybel into single parenthood —

   Poul Anderson is better known for his science fiction, but this slim,
   strange, and utterly engrossing book demonstrates his range as a
   storyteller. A Midsummer Tempest takes place in an alternate version of
   17th century — one where everything Shakespeare wrote actually happened
   and fairies were very much real. Inventive as the premise sounds, this
   one’s really quite faithful as far as Shakespearean fanfic goes: all
   the noble characters speak in iambic pentameter, as if they were
   written by the Bard himself.

   The first installment in the 10-book Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,

   with a protagonist who’s American, a novelist, and newly recovered from
   leprosy, a disease to which he lost two fingers. And as far as his new
   neighbors are concerned, the titular Thomas, with his two missing
   fingers, is a dead ringer for their culture-hero, Berek Halfhand — a

   Terry Brooks’ 1977 fantasy takes place in a post-nuclear-holocaust

   five species: Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, and Elves. The plot centers
   on Shea Ohmsford, a half-elven boy destined to wield a legendary sword
   against a dreaded Warlock Lord. Thanks to this post-apocalyptic
   premise, The Sword of Shannara interweaves fantasy with science
   fiction; you might say it depicts fantasy as a result of science
   fiction, unimaginable violence producing a future that looks like an
   enchanted vision of the past.

   Kindred has been described as a “neo-slave narrative using science

   Kindred “a kind of grim fantasy.” Indeed, its time-traveling
   protagonist, a young black woman named Dana, finds herself flickering
   between 1976 Los Angeles and 1815 Maryland. In the antebellum South,
   she winds up in the company of her own ancestors — an enslaved woman
   named Alice and a slave-owner named Rufus. Butler’s spare prose and

   book as an antidote to the dark lord-y, paint-by-numbers fantasy that

   of Christian missionaries into the land she loves. Her sister-in-law
   Gwenhwyfar, meanwhile, emerges as her opposite: a devout and
   increasingly fanatical Christian. The ideological clash between them

   The Bone Clocks shines with both literary pedigree and imaginative
   worldbuilding, up for both the Man Booker Prize and the World Fantasy
   Award in 2015. Its title hints at the darkly magical world we find
   inside — “bone clocks” are what immortals call the rest of us, ordinary
   humans whose bodies tick out the passage of time through their slow
   decay. We soon encounter two groups of immortals through a bone clock
   named Holly Sykes. But mortal as she is, Holly isn’t an ordinary young
   woman. Her psychic abilities make her a lightning rod for unusual
   phenomena — and the eventual focal point for an epic supernatural war.

   The Buried Giant: A novel (Vintage International)

51. The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro (2015)

   Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro penned this elegiac, post-Arthurian
   fantasy over the course of a difficult decade. The result was well
   worth the wait: The Guardian’s glowing review hailed it as “Game of
   Thrones with a conscience.” The Buried Giant considers the entanglement
   of old age, memory, and national history in a setting infused with the
   otherworld. At its center are an elderly couple named Axl and Beatrice,
   Briton villagers living in a world where King Arthur has died, leaving
   behind a seemingly durable peace. But everyone in Axl and Beatrice’s
   village continues to suffer: not from armed conflict, but from the
   mist, an amnesia that seems to have eaten away all their memories of a
   son they’re certain they’ve lost.

   The Fifth Season (The Broken Earth Book 1)

   The Fifth Season is perhaps N.K. Jemisin's most fully realized work,
   combining her trademark psychological complexity with an
   ultra-immersive world and a magic system of startling originality. It's
   set in a Pangaea-like supercontinent called the Stillness — an ironic
   name, since the land is ravaged periodically by earthquakes. Because of
   this, the Stillness is a dangerous place for orogenes, who have the
   ability to control earthquakes and channel temperature. Called “roggas”
   and savaged by mobs because of their dangerous powers, orogenes rarely
   make it to adulthood. But those who survive — generally by hiding their
   abilities — are herded towards a training facility called the Fulcrum,
   where they suffer oppressions of their own.

   The Grace of Kings (The Dandelion Dynasty Book 1)

53. The Grace of Kings by Ken Liu (2015)

   The first installment in a planned trilogy, The Grace of Kings is
   entertaining as well as erudite. It’s already become a foundational
   work of the sensibility Liu terms “silkpunk”: an East Asian-inflected
   spin on steampunk that trades in gears and goggles for bamboo and
   paper. The Grace of Kings uses this silkpunk framework to rewrite some
   of the most exciting stories from a canonical Han-dynasty text. The
   result is a page-turner even for bookworms who don’t have knowledge of
   Chinese history — and full of delightful easter eggs for those who do.

   Sorcerer to the Crown (A Sorcerer to the Crown Novel Book 1)

54. A Sorcerer to the Crown by Zen Cho (2015)

   Buy on Amazon
   (BUTTON) Add to library

   In A Sorcerer to the Crown, debut novelist Zen Cho serves up historical
   fantasy with humor and heart. Set in a magical version of Regency
   England, it's equal parts white-gloved gentility and side-splitting
   wit. But the story also tackles race with a deft touch: Zacharias Wythe
   is the new Sorcerer Royal of black African descent, and Prunella
   Gentleman is a biracial, magical finishing school drop-out. Together,
   they have to prevent an all-out war between powerful magical factions —
   all while dealing with the constant indignities of prejudice.

   All the Birds in the Sky

   All the Birds in the Sky is a love story for nerds. Sparks fly between
   the compelling leads — and between the two speculative genres they
   represent. Patricia Delfine, a witch, is fantasy. Her childhood friend
   Laurence Armstead, a gadgeteer, is science fiction. But after banding
   together against junior high bullies, the two lose touch: Patricia runs
   from witchcraft accusations to wind up in a school of magic, while
   Laurence is shipped off to military school to shape up among other
   ill-behaved teenage Muggles. Luckily, they reunite as adults — just in
   time to tap into their combined skills to stop the Unraveling of the
   universe.

   Scythe (Arc of a Scythe Book 1)

   In the world of Neal Shusterman's Scythe, hyper-advanced technology has
   eliminated death by natural causes, rendering humans biologically
   immortal. But this seemingly utopian premise turns dystopian with the
   reality that overpopulation is still a problem — and to cull it, a
   select group of citizens must act as “Scythes” to determine who will
   live and die. This is the role taken on by our teenage protagonists,
   Citra and Rowan, who grapple with intense issues of mortality and
   morality as they train to be Scythes — growing more suspicious all the
   while of inner-circle corruption that threatens to derail their
   society.

   The City of Brass: A Novel (The Daevabad Trilogy)

   A dazzling fantasy set in the 18th-century Egypt, The City of Brass
   wraps a tale of magical adventure around a core of Islamic mythology.
   But its heroine is a skeptic — at first. A talented swindler with an
   instinct for healing, Nahri tricks Ottoman nobles into filling her
   purse by claiming magical powers she doesn’t actually have. Then one
   day, she fakes an exorcism... only to find herself face-to-face with a
   very real djinn. This unexpected new acquaintance, named Dara, spirits
   her away to the enchanted, brass-walled city of Daevabad. Here Nahri
   finds out the truth about her own heritage — the key to her talent for
   the healing arts.

   Jade City

   Jade City reads like Game of Thrones meets The Godfather, with a
   modern, pan-Asian aesthetic all its own. In its vividly drawn magical
   underworld, organized crime centers around jade — not the green jewel
   we know, but a mineral that grants superpowers to those who wield it,
   provided they have the right training and genes. After a cataclysmic
   conflict, the One Mountain Society that protected the island of Kekon
   has shattered into rival crime families. As they fight over the future
   of the jade trade, their battles spring to life in stunning fight
   sequences undergirded by Lee's martial arts knowledge and rich
   worldbuilding.

   For anyone ever intrigued by the hush-hush and vaguely felonious
   undercurrents of Ivy League secret societies, Ninth House is the novel
   to sate your imagination. It kicks off with 20-year-old Alex Stern,
   ghost-seer and sole survivor of a brutal homicide, receiving a
   full-ride scholarship to Yale — under the condition that she use her
   spiritually perceptive powers to monitor the university's eight Houses
   of the Vale. As part of the titular ninth house, Lethe, Alex must work
   to uncover the magical abuses of these occult organizations — but what
   she can't know is how dark things will get, and how deeply she's
   enmeshed in them already.

   Finally we've arrived at Starsight, the most recent undertaking by
   fantasy phenom Brandon Sanderson. In this outer-space spectacular,
   Sanderson seamlessly picks up the narrative thread of Spensa Nightshade
   — a passionate, psychically gifted young pilot who's become a key
   weapon in the human war against the alien Krell. Here, Spensa embarks
   on a dangerous undercover mission to steal a Krell hyperdrive, but what
   will happen when her true identity is revealed? (Our only advisory
   before diving headfirst into Starsight is to read the previous
   installment, Skyward, first — especially if you have an Ender's
   Game-shaped hole in your life.)
