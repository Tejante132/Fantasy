   Erling Haaland in other clubs shirts Football players in other clubs
   shirts

So we know a thing or two about
how fantasy football was designed
to be played.

   It's not about Haaland
   appearing in everyone's teams,
   it's about each player only
   playing for one team, just like
   in the Premier League.

Kick off your league by getting together
for a player auction where you bid
against each other for the right
to own each player.

   So if you get Haaland, he's yours and yours
   alone, which really matters…

So when Haaland scores that
all-important important penalty,
or gets a cracking last minute
assist, those points
are yours and ONLY yours…

   So the taste is that much sweeter.
   Surely, this is the way to play
   fantasy football.

So how exactly does it work?

   The action always starts with the auction
   (a.k.a. 'The Best Night Of The Year').
   You all gather round a table (often in a pub)
   and the bidding (often beer-fuelled) begins.
   0nly one thing is certain - when you wake up
   next morning (often with a headache),
   everyone in your league has their own
   unique squad with their own unique players.
   Let the game and the banter begin.

Here's a slice of classic Fantasy League
action to show you exactly what we mean.

Hold on, we're showing you highlights from
10 years ago. Exactly. The players may have
changed but the game goes marching on.
The original and still the best, this is how
fantasy football is meant to be played.

   Hardly surprising as we were the ones that
   started the ball rolling back in 1991, before
   there was a Premier League, never mind
   a Fantasy Premier League, and Erling
   wasn't even a twinkle in a manager's eye.

So, what happens next?

   This is where things get really,
   really easy (think a Halaand tap-in from half a yard).
   Download our starter pack and start rounding up
   your mates for the auction that kicks everything off.
   There are also these four explainer audios here from Jessy and Chris
   who host our #InADifferentLeague podcast There are also these four
   explainer audios on the right.
   And if you still have any questions (like "How did
   Núñez miss that?") just email us and a real human
   from our backroom staff will write straight back.
