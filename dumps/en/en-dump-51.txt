   If you look at all the different things that are called fantasy — and I
   mean just in the context of fantasy literature, not sexual fantasies
   etc. — you start to wonder if there is anything that they all have in
   common or whether, in Wittgenstein’s words, they simply “form a
   family.” Fantasy is one of those things that gets harder to define the
   closer you look at it, like gender or — as Wittgenstein famously
   pointed out — games. In “Philosophy and Fantasy”, Laurence Gagnon gives
   us a definition which seems appealing at first sight: “any story might
   justifiably be called ‘a fantasy’ which gives us some explicit
   indication of the personality of one or more of the characters and
   which is also about a world that is conceivable but physically
   impossible.” However, there is the difficulty of saying exactly what is
   physically impossible; given what we know of physics, dragons are a far
   more likely possibility than faster-than-light travel, yet the latter
   is a staple of science fiction, not fantasy. Moreover, as Gagnon
   admits, the term “fantasy” is here used “in a very general way such
   that some writings called ‘fairy-tales’, some labeled
   ‘science-fiction’, and, perhaps, some designated ‘dream-stories’ will
   fall under the concept of fantasy.” Since Gagnon is interested in
   fantasy as a philosophical tool, that will do for him, but if we are
   interested in fantasy literature, we need something that will explain
   why The Lord of the Rings is definitely fantasy, The Day of the
   Triffids definitely isn’t and Star Wars and Twilight are on the fuzzy
   borders with SF and horror respectively. I recently saw Twilight
   described as “urban fantasy”, which is silly considering that it takes
   place in a village, but does at least note that fangs do not a horror
   film make. Twilight could fairly be described as low fantasy (i.e. a
   tale where fantastic elements are found in the normal world, as opposed
   to high fantasy, which has a world all of its own). But if that is
   true, then should we say the same of Dracula?

   It could be that the distinction between fantasy and horror is of a
   different kind than the distinction between fantasy and science
   fiction. Horror is like comedy or pornography, in that it is a genre
   defined by the feelings it is designed to arouse, whereas fantasy, like
   westerns, is defined by the kind of things it describes. That is why
   such disparate creations as The Saw and The Omen can both be called
   horror films, and why when you reduce the scare quotient in a lot of
   so-called horror, you see that it is fantasy or SF. (Of course there
   are people who are genuinely scared of the vampires in Twilight, but
   they’re just wusses.) The categories of fantasy and horror overlap, not
   because of Wittgensteinian vagueness, but because they should. If you
   have an overlap between the sets of plants and animals, you assume that
   the concepts “plant” and “animal” are a bit fuzzy, but there is nothing
   surprising about an overlap between the set of plants and the set of
   edible things.

   Coming to the more notorious overlap between fantasy and science
   fiction, we therefore need to ask which kind of overlap it is: is it a
   plant/animal or a plant/edible overlap? Both the fantasy and science
   fiction genres are defined largely in terms of what they describe, and
   both involve describing things which we are fairly sure do not exist
   and have never existed. They are also the kind of things which not only
   do not exist but would surprise us if they were to exist. If a
   connoisseur of nineteenth-century fiction were to read in the Times
   Literary Supplement that Madame Bovary was actually a real person, he
   might put down his teacup and murmur “Well I never!” This is probably
   not how we would react if it were proved that Sauron was a real person.

   Both fantasy and science fiction, then, deal with things that make us
   go “wow!” They are “astounding tales,” and in this respect, the genres
   are also a little like horror, in that their definition includes the
   feelings they are designed to evoke. A novel set in a world which was
   exactly the same as ours with addition of toast that always falls with
   the buttered side up would fit Gagnon’s definition of fantasy, but
   would not be fantastic; neither would it make for interesting science
   fiction. But is the “wow” of fantasy the same as the “wow” of science
   fiction? If that were the case, fantasy would be decidedly less
   impressive, as Ryan Somma argues in a fictitious dialogue between
   “fanboy” and “scientist”: for every impressive fantasy creature, device
   or journey, science fiction has something bigger, stronger, faster or
   whatever. Shadowfax may carry Gandalf faster than any horse, but that’s
   still well below the speed of light … or even the speed of a family
   car. But this is not how it works: the “wow” of fantasy is subtly
   different from the “wow” of SF. As I said, dragons are a much more
   feasible proposition than faster than light travel, but dragons strike
   us as more magical and mysterious.

   Let us imagine, then, a science fictional account of dragons (something
   Anne McCaffrey comes close to in the Pern books). Someone, somewhere,
   messes with the genes of birds to make them very big, featherless and
   scaly (in other words, to make dinosaurs). Then they work on the
   digestive system so that the creature produces methane which can then
   be ignited in its mouth. Voila, a dragon, which can then make the story
   interesting by escaping and laying waste to cities. We’re talking
   something between Jurassic Park and Godzilla here.

   This would make passable, if rather unoriginal science fiction, but
   despite the presence of dragons it definitely wouldn’t be fantasy. The
   fact that the dragons’ genesis is explained identifies it as SF, but
   this is not the most important point; it is a side-effect of an
   essential feature of science fiction, which is that it follows, or at
   least claims to follow, the rules of our universe. It may bend them, as
   with FTL travel or telepathy, but it cannot flout them. If a SF novel
   has spaceships travelling faster than light, it doesn’t give a
   satisfactory explanation of how they do it; anyone who could provide
   one would already have a Nobel prize. They may have explanations of a
   kind (“tachyon drives”, “wormholes” etc.) but this is just a way of
   saying “This is happening in our universe, according to the laws of
   that universe.” They are most definitely not saying “Faster than light
   travel is physically impossible, but our hero can do it because he has
   a magic spaceship.” That would be fantasy. What fantasy does is not to
   bend or even flout the rules; it says “The rules here are different.”
   Not only are we not in Kansas any more, we aren’t even in hyper-Kansas.
   This may be what makes the “wow” of fantasy different from the “wow” of
   SF. When Shadowfax gallops at the speed of a Citroen, we aren’t saying
   “Wow, that’s fast!” We’re saying “Wow, a magic horse!”

   This makes sense for high fantasy, when the author has created a world
   that has different rules from ours. But what about low fantasy, where
   strange things happen in our world? I think there are two ways to look
   at this. One is that our world is basically the world as we know it,
   but beings from other worlds have entered it (low fantasy is also
   tellingly called “intrusive fantasy”). In this view, low fantasy is
   like portal fantasy — where our heroes enter another world through some
   kind of gateway, as in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe — but in
   reverse. Buffy the Vampire Slayer uses this idea, with the Hellmouth
   being a kind of portal allowing various kinds of nasties to congregate
   in an otherwise normal American town. In other types of low fantasy,
   however, the supernatural creatures are very much part of our world.
   Here the “wow” factors comes not from the idea that there are magical
   worlds, or that magical creatures can enter our world, but that our
   world is itself magical, and we just need to wake up to the fact. As
   Vampire Bill puts it: “You think that it’s not magic that keeps you
   alive? Just ’cause you understand the mechanics of how something works,
   doesn’t make it any less of a miracle … which is just another word for
   magic. We’re all kept alive by magic, Sookie. My magic’s just a little
   different from yours, that’s all.”

   If it is true that what makes fantasy is the idea of different rules,
   then that would explain why Star Wars sits so uncomfortably (but
   effectively) on the fence between fantasy and SF. It has all the
   trappings of space opera, but we are in no doubt that we are being told
   a fairy tale. When we see those words “A long time ago, in a galaxy
   far, far away …” we don’t think “Hang on, all galaxies are far away. I
   mean the nearest galaxy to us is Andromeda, and that’s 2,500,000 light
   years away.” What we think is “Once upon a time …” and what we
   understand is “The rules are different here.”

   then that would explain why Star Wars sits so uncomfortably (but
   effectively) on the fence between fantasy and SF. It has all the
   trappings of space opera, but we are in no doubt that we are being told
   a fairy tale. When we see those words “A long time ago, in a galaxy
   far, far away …” we don’t think “Hang on, all galaxies are far away. I
   mean the nearest galaxy to us is Andromeda, and that’s 2,500,000 light
   years away.” What we think is “Once upon a time …” and what we
   understand is “The rules are different here.”

   If you look at all the different things that are called fantasy — and I
   mean just in the context of fantasy literature, not sexual fantasies
   etc. — you start to wonder if there is anything that they all have in
   common or whether, in Wittgenstein’s words, they simply “form a
   family.” Fantasy is one of those things that gets harder to define the
   closer you look at it, like gender or — as Wittgenstein famously
   pointed out — games. In “Philosophy and Fantasy”, Laurence Gagnon gives
   us a definition which seems appealing at first sight: “any story might
   justifiably be called ‘a fantasy’ which gives us some explicit
   indication of the personality of one or more of the characters and
   which is also about a world that is conceivable but physically
   impossible.” However, there is the difficulty of saying exactly what is
   physically impossible; given what we know of physics, dragons are a far
   more likely possibility than faster-than-light travel, yet the latter
   is a staple of science fiction, not fantasy. Moreover, as Gagnon
   admits, the term “fantasy” is here used “in a very general way such
   that some writings called ‘fairy-tales’, some labeled
   ‘science-fiction’, and, perhaps, some designated ‘dream-stories’ will
   fall under the concept of fantasy.” Since Gagnon is interested in
   fantasy as a philosophical tool, that will do for him, but if we are
   interested in fantasy literature, we need something that will explain
   why The Lord of the Rings is definitely fantasy, The Day of the
   Triffids definitely isn’t and Star Wars and Twilight are on the fuzzy
   borders with SF and horror respectively. I recently saw Twilight
   described as “urban fantasy”, which is silly considering that it takes
   place in a village, but does at least note that fangs do not a horror
   film make. Twilight could fairly be described as low fantasy (i.e. a
   tale where fantastic elements are found in the normal world, as opposed
   to high fantasy, which has a world all of its own). But if that is
   true, then should we say the same of Dracula?

   It could be that the distinction between fantasy and horror is of a
   different kind than the distinction between fantasy and science
   fiction. Horror is like comedy or pornography, in that it is a genre
   defined by the feelings it is designed to arouse, whereas fantasy, like
   westerns, is defined by the kind of things it describes. That is why
   such disparate creations as The Saw and The Omen can both be called
   horror films, and why when you reduce the scare quotient in a lot of
   so-called horror, you see that it is fantasy or SF. (Of course there
   are people who are genuinely scared of the vampires in Twilight, but
   they’re just wusses.) The categories of fantasy and horror overlap, not
   because of Wittgensteinian vagueness, but because they should. If you
   have an overlap between the sets of plants and animals, you assume that
   the concepts “plant” and “animal” are a bit fuzzy, but there is nothing
   surprising about an overlap between the set of plants and the set of
   edible things.

   Coming to the more notorious overlap between fantasy and science
   fiction, we therefore need to ask which kind of overlap it is: is it a
   plant/animal or a plant/edible overlap? Both the fantasy and science
   fiction genres are defined largely in terms of what they describe, and
   both involve describing things which we are fairly sure do not exist
   and have never existed. They are also the kind of things which not only
   do not exist but would surprise us if they were to exist. If a
   connoisseur of nineteenth-century fiction were to read in the Times
   Literary Supplement that Madame Bovary was actually a real person, he
   might put down his teacup and murmur “Well I never!” This is probably
   not how we would react if it were proved that Sauron was a real person.

   Both fantasy and science fiction, then, deal with things that make us
   go “wow!” They are “astounding tales,” and in this respect, the genres
   are also a little like horror, in that their definition includes the
   feelings they are designed to evoke. A novel set in a world which was
   exactly the same as ours with addition of toast that always falls with
   the buttered side up would fit Gagnon’s definition of fantasy, but
   would not be fantastic; neither would it make for interesting science
   fiction. But is the “wow” of fantasy the same as the “wow” of science
   fiction? If that were the case, fantasy would be decidedly less
   impressive, as Ryan Somma argues in a fictitious dialogue between
   “fanboy” and “scientist”: for every impressive fantasy creature, device
   or journey, science fiction has something bigger, stronger, faster or
   whatever. Shadowfax may carry Gandalf faster than any horse, but that’s
   still well below the speed of light … or even the speed of a family
   car. But this is not how it works: the “wow” of fantasy is subtly
   different from the “wow” of SF. As I said, dragons are a much more
   feasible proposition than faster than light travel, but dragons strike
   us as more magical and mysterious.

   Let us imagine, then, a science fictional account of dragons (something
   Anne McCaffrey comes close to in the Pern books). Someone, somewhere,
   messes with the genes of birds to make them very big, featherless and
   scaly (in other words, to make dinosaurs). Then they work on the
   digestive system so that the creature produces methane which can then
   be ignited in its mouth. Voila, a dragon, which can then make the story
   interesting by escaping and laying waste to cities. We’re talking
   something between Jurassic Park and Godzilla here.

   This would make passable, if rather unoriginal science fiction, but
   despite the presence of dragons it definitely wouldn’t be fantasy. The
   fact that the dragons’ genesis is explained identifies it as SF, but
   this is not the most important point; it is a side-effect of an
   essential feature of science fiction, which is that it follows, or at
   least claims to follow, the rules of our universe. It may bend them, as
   with FTL travel or telepathy, but it cannot flout them. If a SF novel
   has spaceships travelling faster than light, it doesn’t give a
   satisfactory explanation of how they do it; anyone who could provide
   one would already have a Nobel prize. They may have explanations of a
   kind (“tachyon drives”, “wormholes” etc.) but this is just a way of
   saying “This is happening in our universe, according to the laws of
   that universe.” They are most definitely not saying “Faster than light
   travel is physically impossible, but our hero can do it because he has
   a magic spaceship.” That would be fantasy. What fantasy does is not to
   bend or even flout the rules; it says “The rules here are different.”
   Not only are we not in Kansas any more, we aren’t even in hyper-Kansas.
   This may be what makes the “wow” of fantasy different from the “wow” of
   SF. When Shadowfax gallops at the speed of a Citroen, we aren’t saying
   “Wow, that’s fast!” We’re saying “Wow, a magic horse!”

   This makes sense for high fantasy, when the author has created a world
   that has different rules from ours. But what about low fantasy, where
   strange things happen in our world? I think there are two ways to look
   at this. One is that our world is basically the world as we know it,
   but beings from other worlds have entered it (low fantasy is also
   tellingly called “intrusive fantasy”). In this view, low fantasy is
   like portal fantasy — where our heroes enter another world through some
   kind of gateway, as in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe — but in
   reverse. Buffy the Vampire Slayer uses this idea, with the Hellmouth
   being a kind of portal allowing various kinds of nasties to congregate
   in an otherwise normal American town. In other types of low fantasy,
   however, the supernatural creatures are very much part of our world.
   Here the “wow” factors comes not from the idea that there are magical
   worlds, or that magical creatures can enter our world, but that our
   world is itself magical, and we just need to wake up to the fact. As
   Vampire Bill puts it: “You think that it’s not magic that keeps you
   alive? Just ’cause you understand the mechanics of how something works,
   doesn’t make it any less of a miracle … which is just another word for
   magic. We’re all kept alive by magic, Sookie. My magic’s just a little
   different from yours, that’s all.”

   If it is true that what makes fantasy is the idea of different rules,
   then that would explain why Star Wars sits so uncomfortably (but
   effectively) on the fence between fantasy and SF. It has all the
   trappings of space opera, but we are in no doubt that we are being told
   a fairy tale. When we see those words “A long time ago, in a galaxy
   far, far away …” we don’t think “Hang on, all galaxies are far away. I
   mean the nearest galaxy to us is Andromeda, and that’s 2,500,000 light

   This makes sense for high fantasy, when the author has created a world
   that has different rules from ours. But what about low fantasy, where
   strange things happen in our world? I think there are two ways to look
   at this. One is that our world is basically the world as we know it,
   but beings from other worlds have entered it (low fantasy is also
   tellingly called “intrusive fantasy”). In this view, low fantasy is
   like portal fantasy — where our heroes enter another world through some
   kind of gateway, as in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe — but in
   reverse. Buffy the Vampire Slayer uses this idea, with the Hellmouth
   being a kind of portal allowing various kinds of nasties to congregate
   in an otherwise normal American town. In other types of low fantasy,
   however, the supernatural creatures are very much part of our world.
   Here the “wow” factors comes not from the idea that there are magical
   worlds, or that magical creatures can enter our world, but that our
   world is itself magical, and we just need to wake up to the fact. As
   Vampire Bill puts it: “You think that it’s not magic that keeps you
   alive? Just ’cause you understand the mechanics of how something works,
   doesn’t make it any less of a miracle … which is just another word for
   magic. We’re all kept alive by magic, Sookie. My magic’s just a little
   different from yours, that’s all.”

   If it is true that what makes fantasy is the idea of different rules,
   then that would explain why Star Wars sits so uncomfortably (but
   effectively) on the fence between fantasy and SF. It has all the
   trappings of space opera, but we are in no doubt that we are being told
   a fairy tale. When we see those words “A long time ago, in a galaxy
   far, far away …” we don’t think “Hang on, all galaxies are far away. I
   mean the nearest galaxy to us is Andromeda, and that’s 2,500,000 light
   years away.” What we think is “Once upon a time …” and what we
   understand is “The rules are different here.”

   If you look at all the different things that are called fantasy — and I
   mean just in the context of fantasy literature, not sexual fantasies
   etc. — you start to wonder if there is anything that they all have in
   common or whether, in Wittgenstein’s words, they simply “form a
   family.” Fantasy is one of those things that gets harder to define the
   closer you look at it, like gender or — as Wittgenstein famously
   pointed out — games. In “Philosophy and Fantasy”, Laurence Gagnon gives
   us a definition which seems appealing at first sight: “any story might
   justifiably be called ‘a fantasy’ which gives us some explicit
   indication of the personality of one or more of the characters and
   which is also about a world that is conceivable but physically
   impossible.” However, there is the difficulty of saying exactly what is
   physically impossible; given what we know of physics, dragons are a far
   more likely possibility than faster-than-light travel, yet the latter
   is a staple of science fiction, not fantasy. Moreover, as Gagnon
   admits, the term “fantasy” is here used “in a very general way such
   that some writings called ‘fairy-tales’, some labeled
   ‘science-fiction’, and, perhaps, some designated ‘dream-stories’ will
   fall under the concept of fantasy.” Since Gagnon is interested in
   fantasy as a philosophical tool, that will do for him, but if we are
   interested in fantasy literature, we need something that will explain
   why The Lord of the Rings is definitely fantasy, The Day of the
   Triffids definitely isn’t and Star Wars and Twilight are on the fuzzy
   borders with SF and horror respectively. I recently saw Twilight
   described as “urban fantasy”, which is silly considering that it takes
   place in a village, but does at least note that fangs do not a horror
   film make. Twilight could fairly be described as low fantasy (i.e. a
   tale where fantastic elements are found in the normal world, as opposed
   to high fantasy, which has a world all of its own). But if that is
   true, then should we say the same of Dracula?

   It could be that the distinction between fantasy and horror is of a
   different kind than the distinction between fantasy and science
   fiction. Horror is like comedy or pornography, in that it is a genre
   defined by the feelings it is designed to arouse, whereas fantasy, like
   westerns, is defined by the kind of things it describes. That is why
   such disparate creations as The Saw and The Omen can both be called
   horror films, and why when you reduce the scare quotient in a lot of
   so-called horror, you see that it is fantasy or SF. (Of course there
   are people who are genuinely scared of the vampires in Twilight, but
   they’re just wusses.) The categories of fantasy and horror overlap, not
   because of Wittgensteinian vagueness, but because they should. If you
   have an overlap between the sets of plants and animals, you assume that
   the concepts “plant” and “animal” are a bit fuzzy, but there is nothing
   surprising about an overlap between the set of plants and the set of
   edible things.

   Coming to the more notorious overlap between fantasy and science
   fiction, we therefore need to ask which kind of overlap it is: is it a
   plant/animal or a plant/edible overlap? Both the fantasy and science
   fiction genres are defined largely in terms of what they describe, and
   both involve describing things which we are fairly sure do not exist
   and have never existed. They are also the kind of things which not only
   do not exist but would surprise us if they were to exist. If a
   connoisseur of nineteenth-century fiction were to read in the Times
   Literary Supplement that Madame Bovary was actually a real person, he
   might put down his teacup and murmur “Well I never!” This is probably
   not how we would react if it were proved that Sauron was a real person.

   Both fantasy and science fiction, then, deal with things that make us
   go “wow!” They are “astounding tales,” and in this respect, the genres
   are also a little like horror, in that their definition includes the
   feelings they are designed to evoke. A novel set in a world which was
   exactly the same as ours with addition of toast that always falls with
   the buttered side up would fit Gagnon’s definition of fantasy, but
   would not be fantastic; neither would it make for interesting science
   fiction. But is the “wow” of fantasy the same as the “wow” of science
   fiction? If that were the case, fantasy would be decidedly less
   impressive, as Ryan Somma argues in a fictitious dialogue between
   “fanboy” and “scientist”: for every impressive fantasy creature, device
   or journey, science fiction has something bigger, stronger, faster or
   whatever. Shadowfax may carry Gandalf faster than any horse, but that’s
   still well below the speed of light … or even the speed of a family
   car. But this is not how it works: the “wow” of fantasy is subtly
   different from the “wow” of SF. As I said, dragons are a much more
   feasible proposition than faster than light travel, but dragons strike
   us as more magical and mysterious.

   Let us imagine, then, a science fictional account of dragons (something
   Anne McCaffrey comes close to in the Pern books). Someone, somewhere,
   messes with the genes of birds to make them very big, featherless and
   scaly (in other words, to make dinosaurs). Then they work on the
   digestive system so that the creature produces methane which can then
   be ignited in its mouth. Voila, a dragon, which can then make the story
   interesting by escaping and laying waste to cities. We’re talking
   something between Jurassic Park and Godzilla here.

   This would make passable, if rather unoriginal science fiction, but
   despite the presence of dragons it definitely wouldn’t be fantasy. The
   fact that the dragons’ genesis is explained identifies it as SF, but
   this is not the most important point; it is a side-effect of an
   essential feature of science fiction, which is that it follows, or at
   least claims to follow, the rules of our universe. It may bend them, as
   with FTL travel or telepathy, but it cannot flout them. If a SF novel
   has spaceships travelling faster than light, it doesn’t give a
   satisfactory explanation of how they do it; anyone who could provide
   one would already have a Nobel prize. They may have explanations of a
   kind (“tachyon drives”, “wormholes” etc.) but this is just a way of
   saying “This is happening in our universe, according to the laws of
   that universe.” They are most definitely not saying “Faster than light
   travel is physically impossible, but our hero can do it because he has
   a magic spaceship.” That would be fantasy. What fantasy does is not to
   bend or even flout the rules; it says “The rules here are different.”
   Not only are we not in Kansas any more, we aren’t even in hyper-Kansas.
   This may be what makes the “wow” of fantasy different from the “wow” of
   SF. When Shadowfax gallops at the speed of a Citroen, we aren’t saying
   “Wow, that’s fast!” We’re saying “Wow, a magic horse!”

   This makes sense for high fantasy, when the author has created a world
