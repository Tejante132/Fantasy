   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   EW fantasy is mostly bombastic and "big", and not intimistic or "calm".

   Looks interesting! Though i would have to get the full version of
   kontakt. I see. I'll have to take a deeper look at what kind of sound I
   want, cuz from what I've heard of Fantasy orchestra, it sounds really

   Era II Medieval Legends takes after more general continental Europe,
   with a few outliers sprinkled here and there. Celtic Era II focuses
   specifically on Celtic instruments.

   Lumina in terms of overall package, Rinascimento for medieval
   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   What exactly do you mean by quieter tavern stuff - a harp with a flute

   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what I want as well. HFO seems to use
   small ensembles for a lot of its instruments instead of solo
   instruments. Do you think it will sound weird when writing more exposed
   chill parts?

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
   libraries of Stefano Macarelli for the voices (and many other stuff),
   in particular Prometheus and Atlantis 3.
   There is a nice free Irish Harp in the Komplet Start and a beautiful
   free grand Harp in Project Sam's free orchestra 2.
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   There are very few medieval instruments in it (an Hurdy Gurdy - not bad
   sounding, a fiddle that I don't really like, and some flutes, and the
   voices maybe). Dulcimers and luths are not medieval (they are asian or
   eastern instruments in that collection, not the medieval version, even
   if they can do the job). They are quite simple and variable in quality
   IMO.
   If you are looking for an Hurdy Gurdy there are some free ones around
   (at Sonokinetic for example)
   Personnal opinion : the new Chris Hein's hybrid winds has a very Howard
   Shore's sounding ! Maybe you can think about that option too :)

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional
   tavern/folk music, then no, it isn't good for that. And to be fair,
   even Nick Phoenix himself has said that it was never meant to be a
   competitor to the ERA series or the like. It's an alternate take on the
   orchestra, not a folk library.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5
   recorder registers, from bass to sopranino. You might get also a
   special discount on it out of nowhere if you get Ivory Wind from them,
   which is a FREE recorder! If you're not hung on having true legato,
   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap
   psaltery can be purchased from Xperimenta, who also have a tasty
   harpsichord. While I'm on the topic of keyboards, you can also get a
   solid virginal from Sampletekk.
   Harps. Gotta love harps. The free Irish harp in Komplete Start is quite
   good. The Fairy Tale Harp from Hephaestus Sounds has a good amount of
   "dirt" to it, and I'm sure the new harp freebie from Straight Ahead
   Samples would work well too. A lyre could also work, and Unreal
   Instruments has a nice one in their free Small Instruments Collection.
   A frame drum for percussion would be good too. There are tons of good
   free options, but my personal favorite is Framedrum 22″, available in
   the Pulse Store... the brushed articulation lets me pretend i'm making
   weird medieval jazz. (Pro tip: use the SnareBuzz VST on your frame
   drums to get a cool bristly sound. That said, for other percussion
   instruments, just about anything is fair game and probably has a solid
   free option for it as well. Tambourines, triangles, bodhrans,
   whatever.)
   As for a fiddle, I'd not only be looking into violin libraries but also
   viola libraries, as violas sound more like medieval vielles. Obviously
   an actual vielle would be ideal, but yeah. 8Dio's Deep Solo Viola has
   the right character for it in my opinion... not an ideal option, but if
   you want a viola and also want to save money, it'll do the trick. Just
   don't use the normal legato... literally every other legato patch
   sounds better.
   For whistles/flutes, lots of good free options once again, but I really
   dig the control/variety you can get out of O'Malley's Irish Whistles.
   Unreal Instruments has a great and very usable free set in their Two
   Whistles library too.
   If I knew I'd buy/download all of these, regardless of the discounts I
   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.

   HFO can totally be used for chill and mellow settings, however it won't
   provide you with a harp.
   Besides the above mentioned libraries, you might also find interesting
   Soniccouture's The Conservatoire Collection. Alas, no harp there
   either.

   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what I want as well. HFO seems to use
   small ensembles for a lot of its instruments instead of solo
   instruments. Do you think it will sound weird when writing more exposed
   chill parts?

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
   libraries of Stefano Macarelli for the voices (and many other stuff),
   in particular Prometheus and Atlantis 3.
   There is a nice free Irish Harp in the Komplet Start and a beautiful
   free grand Harp in Project Sam's free orchestra 2.
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   There are very few medieval instruments in it (an Hurdy Gurdy - not bad
   sounding, a fiddle that I don't really like, and some flutes, and the
   voices maybe). Dulcimers and luths are not medieval (they are asian or
   eastern instruments in that collection, not the medieval version, even
   if they can do the job). They are quite simple and variable in quality
   IMO.
   If you are looking for an Hurdy Gurdy there are some free ones around
   (at Sonokinetic for example)
   Personnal opinion : the new Chris Hein's hybrid winds has a very Howard
   Shore's sounding ! Maybe you can think about that option too :)

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional
   tavern/folk music, then no, it isn't good for that. And to be fair,
   even Nick Phoenix himself has said that it was never meant to be a
   competitor to the ERA series or the like. It's an alternate take on the
   orchestra, not a folk library.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5
   recorder registers, from bass to sopranino. You might get also a
   special discount on it out of nowhere if you get Ivory Wind from them,
   which is a FREE recorder! If you're not hung on having true legato,
   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap
   psaltery can be purchased from Xperimenta, who also have a tasty
   harpsichord. While I'm on the topic of keyboards, you can also get a
   solid virginal from Sampletekk.
   Harps. Gotta love harps. The free Irish harp in Komplete Start is quite
   good. The Fairy Tale Harp from Hephaestus Sounds has a good amount of
   "dirt" to it, and I'm sure the new harp freebie from Straight Ahead
   Samples would work well too. A lyre could also work, and Unreal
   Instruments has a nice one in their free Small Instruments Collection.
   A frame drum for percussion would be good too. There are tons of good
   free options, but my personal favorite is Framedrum 22″, available in
   the Pulse Store... the brushed articulation lets me pretend i'm making
   weird medieval jazz. (Pro tip: use the SnareBuzz VST on your frame
   drums to get a cool bristly sound. That said, for other percussion
   instruments, just about anything is fair game and probably has a solid
   free option for it as well. Tambourines, triangles, bodhrans,
   whatever.)
   As for a fiddle, I'd not only be looking into violin libraries but also
   viola libraries, as violas sound more like medieval vielles. Obviously
   an actual vielle would be ideal, but yeah. 8Dio's Deep Solo Viola has
   the right character for it in my opinion... not an ideal option, but if
   you want a viola and also want to save money, it'll do the trick. Just
   don't use the normal legato... literally every other legato patch
   sounds better.
   For whistles/flutes, lots of good free options once again, but I really
   dig the control/variety you can get out of O'Malley's Irish Whistles.
   Unreal Instruments has a great and very usable free set in their Two
   Whistles library too.
   If I knew I'd buy/download all of these, regardless of the discounts I
   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.

   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   Looks interesting! Though i would have to get the full version of

   want, cuz from what I've heard of Fantasy orchestra, it sounds really
   nice.

   Era II Medieval Legends takes after more general continental Europe,
   with a few outliers sprinkled here and there. Celtic Era II focuses
   specifically on Celtic instruments.

   Lumina in terms of overall package, Rinascimento for medieval
   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.

   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   Era II Medieval Legends takes after more general continental Europe,
   with a few outliers sprinkled here and there. Celtic Era II focuses

   Lumina in terms of overall package, Rinascimento for medieval
   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   What exactly do you mean by quieter tavern stuff - a harp with a flute
   and some percussion?
   HFO can totally be used for chill and mellow settings, however it won't
   provide you with a harp.
   Besides the above mentioned libraries, you might also find interesting
   Soniccouture's The Conservatoire Collection. Alas, no harp there

   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what I want as well. HFO seems to use
   small ensembles for a lot of its instruments instead of solo
   instruments. Do you think it will sound weird when writing more exposed

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
   libraries of Stefano Macarelli for the voices (and many other stuff),
   in particular Prometheus and Atlantis 3.
   There is a nice free Irish Harp in the Komplet Start and a beautiful
   free grand Harp in Project Sam's free orchestra 2.
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   There are very few medieval instruments in it (an Hurdy Gurdy - not bad
   sounding, a fiddle that I don't really like, and some flutes, and the
   voices maybe). Dulcimers and luths are not medieval (they are asian or
   eastern instruments in that collection, not the medieval version, even
   if they can do the job). They are quite simple and variable in quality
   IMO.
   If you are looking for an Hurdy Gurdy there are some free ones around
   (at Sonokinetic for example)
   Personnal opinion : the new Chris Hein's hybrid winds has a very Howard
   Shore's sounding ! Maybe you can think about that option too :)

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional
   tavern/folk music, then no, it isn't good for that. And to be fair,
   even Nick Phoenix himself has said that it was never meant to be a
   competitor to the ERA series or the like. It's an alternate take on the
   orchestra, not a folk library.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5
   recorder registers, from bass to sopranino. You might get also a
   special discount on it out of nowhere if you get Ivory Wind from them,
   which is a FREE recorder! If you're not hung on having true legato,
   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap
   psaltery can be purchased from Xperimenta, who also have a tasty
   harpsichord. While I'm on the topic of keyboards, you can also get a
   solid virginal from Sampletekk.
   Harps. Gotta love harps. The free Irish harp in Komplete Start is quite
   good. The Fairy Tale Harp from Hephaestus Sounds has a good amount of
   "dirt" to it, and I'm sure the new harp freebie from Straight Ahead
   Samples would work well too. A lyre could also work, and Unreal
   Instruments has a nice one in their free Small Instruments Collection.
   A frame drum for percussion would be good too. There are tons of good
   free options, but my personal favorite is Framedrum 22″, available in
   the Pulse Store... the brushed articulation lets me pretend i'm making
   weird medieval jazz. (Pro tip: use the SnareBuzz VST on your frame
   drums to get a cool bristly sound. That said, for other percussion
   instruments, just about anything is fair game and probably has a solid
   free option for it as well. Tambourines, triangles, bodhrans,
   whatever.)
   As for a fiddle, I'd not only be looking into violin libraries but also
   viola libraries, as violas sound more like medieval vielles. Obviously
   an actual vielle would be ideal, but yeah. 8Dio's Deep Solo Viola has
   the right character for it in my opinion... not an ideal option, but if
   you want a viola and also want to save money, it'll do the trick. Just
   don't use the normal legato... literally every other legato patch
   sounds better.
   For whistles/flutes, lots of good free options once again, but I really
   dig the control/variety you can get out of O'Malley's Irish Whistles.
   Unreal Instruments has a great and very usable free set in their Two
   Whistles library too.
   If I knew I'd buy/download all of these, regardless of the discounts I
   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.

   A lot of the Karoryfer stuff if you like your fantasy stuff a little
   quirkier. And Insanity Samples Shire Winds is a nice one.

   What exactly do you mean by quieter tavern stuff - a harp with a flute
   and some percussion?
   HFO can totally be used for chill and mellow settings, however it won't
   provide you with a harp.
   Besides the above mentioned libraries, you might also find interesting
   Soniccouture's The Conservatoire Collection. Alas, no harp there

   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what I want as well. HFO seems to use
   small ensembles for a lot of its instruments instead of solo
   instruments. Do you think it will sound weird when writing more exposed
   chill parts?

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
   libraries of Stefano Macarelli for the voices (and many other stuff),
   in particular Prometheus and Atlantis 3.
   There is a nice free Irish Harp in the Komplet Start and a beautiful
   free grand Harp in Project Sam's free orchestra 2.
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   There are very few medieval instruments in it (an Hurdy Gurdy - not bad
   sounding, a fiddle that I don't really like, and some flutes, and the
   voices maybe). Dulcimers and luths are not medieval (they are asian or
   eastern instruments in that collection, not the medieval version, even
   if they can do the job). They are quite simple and variable in quality
   IMO.
   If you are looking for an Hurdy Gurdy there are some free ones around
   (at Sonokinetic for example)
   Personnal opinion : the new Chris Hein's hybrid winds has a very Howard
   Shore's sounding ! Maybe you can think about that option too :)

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional
   tavern/folk music, then no, it isn't good for that. And to be fair,
   even Nick Phoenix himself has said that it was never meant to be a
   competitor to the ERA series or the like. It's an alternate take on the
   orchestra, not a folk library.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5
   recorder registers, from bass to sopranino. You might get also a
   special discount on it out of nowhere if you get Ivory Wind from them,
   which is a FREE recorder! If you're not hung on having true legato,
   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap
   psaltery can be purchased from Xperimenta, who also have a tasty
   harpsichord. While I'm on the topic of keyboards, you can also get a
   solid virginal from Sampletekk.
   Harps. Gotta love harps. The free Irish harp in Komplete Start is quite
   good. The Fairy Tale Harp from Hephaestus Sounds has a good amount of
   "dirt" to it, and I'm sure the new harp freebie from Straight Ahead
   Samples would work well too. A lyre could also work, and Unreal
   Instruments has a nice one in their free Small Instruments Collection.
   A frame drum for percussion would be good too. There are tons of good
   free options, but my personal favorite is Framedrum 22″, available in
   the Pulse Store... the brushed articulation lets me pretend i'm making
   weird medieval jazz. (Pro tip: use the SnareBuzz VST on your frame
   drums to get a cool bristly sound. That said, for other percussion
   instruments, just about anything is fair game and probably has a solid
   free option for it as well. Tambourines, triangles, bodhrans,
   whatever.)
   As for a fiddle, I'd not only be looking into violin libraries but also
   viola libraries, as violas sound more like medieval vielles. Obviously
   an actual vielle would be ideal, but yeah. 8Dio's Deep Solo Viola has
   the right character for it in my opinion... not an ideal option, but if
   you want a viola and also want to save money, it'll do the trick. Just
   don't use the normal legato... literally every other legato patch
   sounds better.
   For whistles/flutes, lots of good free options once again, but I really
   dig the control/variety you can get out of O'Malley's Irish Whistles.
   Unreal Instruments has a great and very usable free set in their Two
   Whistles library too.
   If I knew I'd buy/download all of these, regardless of the discounts I
   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.

   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   Looks interesting! Though i would have to get the full version of

   Era II Medieval Legends takes after more general continental Europe,
   with a few outliers sprinkled here and there. Celtic Era II focuses
   specifically on Celtic instruments.

   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap
   psaltery can be purchased from Xperimenta, who also have a tasty
   harpsichord. While I'm on the topic of keyboards, you can also get a
   solid virginal from Sampletekk.
   Harps. Gotta love harps. The free Irish harp in Komplete Start is quite
   good. The Fairy Tale Harp from Hephaestus Sounds has a good amount of
   "dirt" to it, and I'm sure the new harp freebie from Straight Ahead
   Samples would work well too. A lyre could also work, and Unreal
   Instruments has a nice one in their free Small Instruments Collection.
   A frame drum for percussion would be good too. There are tons of good
   free options, but my personal favorite is Framedrum 22″, available in
   the Pulse Store... the brushed articulation lets me pretend i'm making
   weird medieval jazz. (Pro tip: use the SnareBuzz VST on your frame
   drums to get a cool bristly sound. That said, for other percussion
   instruments, just about anything is fair game and probably has a solid
   free option for it as well. Tambourines, triangles, bodhrans,
   whatever.)
   As for a fiddle, I'd not only be looking into violin libraries but also
   viola libraries, as violas sound more like medieval vielles. Obviously
   an actual vielle would be ideal, but yeah. 8Dio's Deep Solo Viola has
   the right character for it in my opinion... not an ideal option, but if
   you want a viola and also want to save money, it'll do the trick. Just
   don't use the normal legato... literally every other legato patch
   sounds better.
   For whistles/flutes, lots of good free options once again, but I really
   dig the control/variety you can get out of O'Malley's Irish Whistles.
   Unreal Instruments has a great and very usable free set in their Two
   Whistles library too.
   If I knew I'd buy/download all of these, regardless of the discounts I
   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.

   Hey, what are some best fantasy instrument VSTs that you guys think are
   good? Thinking mainly of something like "Western/European" fantasy like
   Skyrim and Tavern and minstrel stuff. I've been looking at EastWest
   Hollywood Fantasy Orchestra, is it good? Can it do quieter tavern
   stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.
   Thanks in advance!

   Looks interesting! Though i would have to get the full version of
   kontakt. I see. I'll have to take a deeper look at what kind of sound I
   want, cuz from what I've heard of Fantasy orchestra, it sounds really
   nice.

   hmm, what is the difference between that and the Celtic ERA II? It

   Era II Medieval Legends takes after more general continental Europe,
   with a few outliers sprinkled here and there. Celtic Era II focuses
   specifically on Celtic instruments.

   Lumina in terms of overall package, Rinascimento for medieval
   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   What exactly do you mean by quieter tavern stuff - a harp with a flute
   and some percussion?
   HFO can totally be used for chill and mellow settings, however it won't
   provide you with a harp.
   Besides the above mentioned libraries, you might also find interesting
   Soniccouture's The Conservatoire Collection. Alas, no harp there

   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what I want as well. HFO seems to use
   small ensembles for a lot of its instruments instead of solo
   instruments. Do you think it will sound weird when writing more exposed
   chill parts?

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
   libraries of Stefano Macarelli for the voices (and many other stuff),
   in particular Prometheus and Atlantis 3.
   There is a nice free Irish Harp in the Komplet Start and a beautiful
   free grand Harp in Project Sam's free orchestra 2.
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   There are very few medieval instruments in it (an Hurdy Gurdy - not bad
   sounding, a fiddle that I don't really like, and some flutes, and the
   voices maybe). Dulcimers and luths are not medieval (they are asian or
   eastern instruments in that collection, not the medieval version, even
   if they can do the job). They are quite simple and variable in quality
   IMO.
   If you are looking for an Hurdy Gurdy there are some free ones around
   (at Sonokinetic for example)
   Personnal opinion : the new Chris Hein's hybrid winds has a very Howard
   Shore's sounding ! Maybe you can think about that option too :)

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional
   tavern/folk music, then no, it isn't good for that. And to be fair,
   even Nick Phoenix himself has said that it was never meant to be a
   competitor to the ERA series or the like. It's an alternate take on the
   orchestra, not a folk library.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5
   recorder registers, from bass to sopranino. You might get also a
   special discount on it out of nowhere if you get Ivory Wind from them,
   which is a FREE recorder! If you're not hung on having true legato,
   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap

   nice.

   ERA II Medieval Legends should fit the bill perfectly.

   hmm, what is the difference between that and the Celtic ERA II? It
   seems a few years old, does it still hold up well?

   Era II Medieval Legends takes after more general continental Europe,
   with a few outliers sprinkled here and there. Celtic Era II focuses
   specifically on Celtic instruments.

   Lumina in terms of overall package, Rinascimento for medieval
   instruments, Eduardo Tarilonte: Era 2, Celtic 2 and Dark era would
   cover everything. Also consider a good harp library, my favorite is
   cinesamples, there's so much variation and detail with them, but you do
   get quite a few harps in the Eduardo Tarilonte libraries. Fantasy genre
   is absolutely my favourite!!

   How well does Era 2 play since it's an older library?

   A lot of the Karoryfer stuff if you like your fantasy stuff a little
   quirkier. And Insanity Samples Shire Winds is a nice one.

   Can it do quieter tavern stuff? What other VSTs do you all recommend.

   What exactly do you mean by quieter tavern stuff - a harp with a flute
   and some percussion?
   HFO can totally be used for chill and mellow settings, however it won't
   provide you with a harp.
   Besides the above mentioned libraries, you might also find interesting
   Soniccouture's The Conservatoire Collection. Alas, no harp there
   either.

   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what I want as well. HFO seems to use
   small ensembles for a lot of its instruments instead of solo
   instruments. Do you think it will sound weird when writing more exposed
   chill parts?

   I agree with the options above !
   EW Fantasy is good but it's not a very intimate sound because they are
   ensembles. I also think about Albion Solstice, Groth, Lores (for dark
   med inspired ambiant and texture) and Sonokenitic Fantasy (if you like
   working with phrases, and for "light" fantasy).
   You can also have some very nice solo intruments for a good price :
   Have audio's Rebec, bass recorder, crumhorn, Kantele are really not
   pricy, Nordik Folk Strings from Silence and Other sound, and the
   libraries of Stefano Macarelli for the voices (and many other stuff),
   in particular Prometheus and Atlantis 3.
   There is a nice free Irish Harp in the Komplet Start and a beautiful
   free grand Harp in Project Sam's free orchestra 2.
   More classic instruments can fit very well for medieval : simple
   mandolins, flutes, organs, voices can be very useful !
   Also note that some eastern intruments like the Oud can blend very well
   into medieval/fantasy inspired music.

   Sonokinetic Fantasy is great for adding some icing on the cake, but
   it’s phrase-based, so you really can’t use it to compose. It’s a very
   nice way to add some sparkle after your composition is finished.

   There are very few medieval instruments in it (an Hurdy Gurdy - not bad
   sounding, a fiddle that I don't really like, and some flutes, and the
   voices maybe). Dulcimers and luths are not medieval (they are asian or
   eastern instruments in that collection, not the medieval version, even
   if they can do the job). They are quite simple and variable in quality
   IMO.
   If you are looking for an Hurdy Gurdy there are some free ones around
   (at Sonokinetic for example)
   Personnal opinion : the new Chris Hein's hybrid winds has a very Howard
   Shore's sounding ! Maybe you can think about that option too :)

   For what it's worth, I've played around with Fantasy Orchestra and
   agree with others' assessment of it. It surely is a good library and
   can be used to make a fantasy score really well. If you're just
   thinking Skyrim overworld, it can surely do that. Probably even an epic
   tavern-esque theme, if you get creative with it.
   But if you want something small-scale that can make actual traditional
   tavern/folk music, then no, it isn't good for that. And to be fair,
   even Nick Phoenix himself has said that it was never meant to be a
   competitor to the ERA series or the like. It's an alternate take on the
   orchestra, not a folk library.

   For quiet medieval-ish music, I can recommend a few that haven't been
   mentioned here. Too many, perhaps. But I feel morally obligated to dump
   this info on you, so BEAR WITH ME!
   Karoryfer has a great fantasy collection. For the sake of brevity, I
   won't go into detail, but yes, I agree with the Doc that they have good
   stuff. Lovely tagelharpas.
   Embertone's Recorders is a really bangin' collection. Gives you 5
   recorder registers, from bass to sopranino. You might get also a
   special discount on it out of nowhere if you get Ivory Wind from them,
   which is a FREE recorder! If you're not hung on having true legato,
   though, the Kontakt Factory recorders are perfectly serviceable.
   You might want some kind of zither or a psaltery. Loops de la Crème's
   Gipsy Zither is lovely. You can also get a solid free psaltery from
   Bolder Sounds or Versilian Studio's VCSL collection. VCSL also has a
   lot of other acoustic instruments, including recorders. A dirt cheap
   psaltery can be purchased from Xperimenta, who also have a tasty
   harpsichord. While I'm on the topic of keyboards, you can also get a
   solid virginal from Sampletekk.
   Harps. Gotta love harps. The free Irish harp in Komplete Start is quite
   good. The Fairy Tale Harp from Hephaestus Sounds has a good amount of
   "dirt" to it, and I'm sure the new harp freebie from Straight Ahead
   Samples would work well too. A lyre could also work, and Unreal
   Instruments has a nice one in their free Small Instruments Collection.
   A frame drum for percussion would be good too. There are tons of good
   free options, but my personal favorite is Framedrum 22″, available in
   the Pulse Store... the brushed articulation lets me pretend i'm making
   weird medieval jazz. (Pro tip: use the SnareBuzz VST on your frame
   drums to get a cool bristly sound. That said, for other percussion
   instruments, just about anything is fair game and probably has a solid
   free option for it as well. Tambourines, triangles, bodhrans,
   whatever.)
   As for a fiddle, I'd not only be looking into violin libraries but also
   viola libraries, as violas sound more like medieval vielles. Obviously
   an actual vielle would be ideal, but yeah. 8Dio's Deep Solo Viola has
   the right character for it in my opinion... not an ideal option, but if
   you want a viola and also want to save money, it'll do the trick. Just
   don't use the normal legato... literally every other legato patch
   sounds better.
   For whistles/flutes, lots of good free options once again, but I really
   dig the control/variety you can get out of O'Malley's Irish Whistles.
   Unreal Instruments has a great and very usable free set in their Two
   Whistles library too.
   If I knew I'd buy/download all of these, regardless of the discounts I
   got, I'd have invested in one of the larger packages like ERA II,
   Rinascimento, Goblinity, or Orcophony. The latter two are very nicely
   discounted right now actually. You would most definitely get material
   that overlaps with what i've said, and it'd likely be more
   cost-effective if you're serious about making fantasy music.
   But hey, if you need a cheap/free/niche addition to the cast, my list
   is here for you. I can maybe add a few louder instruments later but
   this post is long enough as is.
