    Location   Theater an der Wien, Vienna
   Performers  Ludwig van Beethoven (piano)

   The Fantasy for piano, vocal soloists, mixed chorus, and orchestra,
   Op. 80, usually called the Choral Fantasy, was composed in 1808 by then
   38-year-old Ludwig van Beethoven.

   Beethoven intended the Fantasy to serve as the concluding work for the
   benefit concert he put on for himself on 22 December 1808; the
   performers consisted of vocal soloists, mixed chorus, an orchestra, and
   Beethoven himself as piano soloist. The Fantasy was designed to include
   all the participants in the program and thus unites all of these
   musical forces.

   The work is noted as a precursor to the later Ninth Symphony.

Background, composition, and premiere

   [edit]

   The Fantasia was first performed at the Akademie of 22 December 1808, a
   benefit concert which also saw the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth
   Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto as well as a performance of
   excerpts of the Mass in C major. To conclude this memorable concert
   program, Beethoven wanted a "brilliant finale" that would unite in a
   single piece the different musical elements highlighted in the concert
   night: piano solo, mixed chorus and orchestra. The Fantasia, Op. 80,
   written shortly before, was thus composed expressly to fulfil this
   role. Beethoven himself played the piano part and the opening solo
   offers an example of his improvisational style (at the premiere he did,
   in fact, improvise this section).

   Beethoven wrote the piece during the second half of December 1808 in an
   unusually short time by his standards. He commissioned a poet—whose
   identity is disputed—to write the words shortly before the performance
   to fit the already written parts. According to Beethoven's pupil Carl
   Czerny, the poet was Christoph Kuffner [de],^[1] but the later
   Beethoven scholar Gustav Nottebohm doubted this attribution and
   suggested it may have been Georg Friedrich Treitschke, who in 1814
   prepared the final text of Beethoven's opera Fidelio.^[2]

   The premiere performance seems to have been a rather troubled one;
   according to the composer's secretary, Anton Schindler, it "simply fell
   apart", a result most likely attributable to insufficient rehearsal
   time. Because of a mistake in the execution of the piece, it was
   stopped halfway through and restarted.^[3] In Ignaz von Seyfried's
   words:^[4]^[5]

     When the master brought out his orchestral Fantasia with choruses,
     he arranged with me at the somewhat hurried rehearsal, with wet^[6]
     voice-parts as usual, that the second variation should be played
     without repeat. In the evening, however, absorbed in his creation,
     he forgot all about the instructions which he had given, repeated
     the first part while the orchestra accompanied the second, which
     sounded not altogether edifying. A trifle too late, the
     Concertmaster, Unrath, noticed the mistake, looked in surprise at
     his lost companions, stopped playing and called out dryly: 'Again!'
     A little displeased, the violinist Anton Wranitzky asked 'With
     repeats?' 'Yes', came the answer, and now the thing went straight as
     a string.

The Choral Fantasy and the Ninth Symphony

   [edit]

   The work includes a sequence of variations on a theme that is widely
   felt to be an early version of a far better known variation theme,
   namely the one to which Beethoven set the words of Friedrich Schiller's
   "Ode to Joy" in his Ninth Symphony. The two themes are compared below.

          fis) | fis4.( e8) e2 } } } Audio playback is not supported in
          your browser. You can download the audio file.

   Michael Broyles has suggested another musical similarity: the two works
   share essentially the same harmonic sequence at their climactic
   moments, the chords (in C major) C–F–D–(G)–E♭, where the E♭ stands out
   from its harmonic context and is performed fortissimo. The words sung
   at this point are (for the Choral Fantasy) "Lieb und Kraft" ("love and
   strength") and (for the Ninth Symphony) "Über'm Sternenzelt! Über
   Sternen muss er wohnen." ("Above the tent of the stars, above the stars
   he must dwell.")^[7]

   There are also affinities in the texts. The theme of the Choral Fantasy
   text – universal fraternity with the meeting of arts – evokes similar
   feelings as the "Ode to Joy" text.

   Beethoven himself acknowledged the kinship of the two works. In a
   letter of 1824, when he was writing the Ninth Symphony, he described
   his project as "a setting of the words of Schiller's immortal 'Lied an
   die Freude' in the same way as my pianoforte fantasia with chorus, but
   on a far grander scale."^[8]

   The Choral Fantasy theme is itself taken from an earlier work by
   Beethoven: it is a slightly modified version of the composer's "Seufzer
   eines Ungeliebten – Gegenliebe,” a lied for high voice and piano
   written c. 1794–1795.^[9]

   and the Washtenaw Community Orchestra Chorus in 2009

   The Choral Fantasy, which lasts about twenty minutes, is divided into
   two movements, played without a break:
    1. Adagio
    2. Finale. Allegro – Meno allegro (Allegretto) – Allegro molto –
       Adagio ma non troppo – Marcia, assai vivace – Allegro – Allegretto
       ma non troppo quasi andante con moto Schmeichelnd hold und lieblich
       klingen – Presto

   The piece is scored for solo piano, mixed chorus, two soprano soloists,
   an alto soloist, two tenor soloists, a bass soloist, and an orchestra
   consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two
   horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

   The Fantasy opens with a slow but virtuosic 26-bar piano introduction,
   beginning in C minor and modulating through a variety of keys in
   florid, improvisatory fashion. At its midpoint it settles on the
   dominant of the dominant, G major, with an extended cadenza. The
   implied key is never confirmed and the music eventually returns to C
   minor in a stormy passage, which at the last moment turns once more
   toward the dominant seventh of G in a sweeping arpeggio. This concludes
   the opening section.

   The main part of the piece, marked "Finale", begins with a march-like
   motive (Allegro) played by the cellos and basses, alternating with
   recitative-like interjections from the piano. The music eventually
   brightens into C major and the solo piano introduces the principal
   theme (meno allegro) discussed above. Variations on the theme are then
   played by gradually increasing contingents of instruments: a solo
   flute, two oboes, a trio of two clarinets and bassoon, and string
   quartet. A full orchestral version of the theme played at a forte
   dynamic leads to the re-entry of the piano and to what seems at first
   like a postlude to this variation set, but that once again turns toward
   the dominant. The music pauses with a cadenza on the dominant seventh
   for the solo piano.

   There is an abrupt change of mood as the minor mode returns in a stormy
   Allegro molto. The alternating phrases for piano and orchestra are a
   disguised variation of the principal theme. In fact, the three sections
   that follow the first variation set form another, larger-scale set of
   variations. The allegro molto soon takes on a developmental quality
   with a series of modulations, the strings playing phrases of the theme
   accompanied by rapid broken chords on the solo piano. After another
   cadenza on an E major triad the second large variation (Adagio, ma non
   troppo) follows, a calm, flowing A major section prominently featuring
   the clarinets. This ends with a call-and-response section between
   double reeds, horn, and piano, and leads without break into the key of
   F major and the third variation on the main theme, Marcia (assai
   vivace). A reprise of the instrumental theme from the first Allegro
   forms the transition into the choral finale (Allegretto).

   The first half of this is essentially a recapitulation of previously
   heard material at the beginning of the Finale with the addition of solo
   voices and chorus, another point of similarity with the finale of the
   Ninth Symphony. After a prolonged dominant pedal and arpeggios from the
   soloist the chorus, two solo sopranos sing the main theme, followed by
   a variation featuring a trio of men's voices. After these two
   variations the entire chorus is joined by the orchestra for the first
   time in a tutti rendition of the theme. The music gains excitement and
   eventually breaks into an accelerated coda (Presto) with all forces
   joining to bring the piece to a triumphant close.

Text

   [edit]

   Schmeichelnd hold und lieblich klingen
   unseres Lebens Harmonien,
   und dem Schönheitssinn entschwingen
   Blumen sich, die ewig blühn.
   Fried und Freude gleiten freundlich
   wie der Wellen Wechselspiel.
   Was sich drängte rauh und feindlich,
   ordnet sich zu Hochgefühl.
   Wenn der Töne Zauber walten
   und des Wortes Weihe spricht,
   muss sich Herrliches gestalten,
   Nacht und Stürme werden Licht.
   Äuß're Ruhe, inn're Wonne
   herrschen für den Glücklichen.
   Doch der Künste Frühlingssonne
   läßt aus beiden Licht entstehn.
   Großes, das ins Herz gedrungen,
   blüht dann neu und schön empor.
   Hat ein Geist sich aufgeschwungen,
   hallt ihm stets ein Geisterchor.
   Nehmt denn hin, ihr schönen Seelen,
   froh die Gaben schöner Kunst
   Wenn sich Lieb und Kraft vermählen,
   lohnt den Menschen Göttergunst.^[10]

   Graceful, charming and sweet is the sound
   Of our life's harmonies,
   and from a sense of beauty arise
   Flowers which eternally bloom.
   Peace and joy advance in perfect concord,
   like the changing play of the waves.
   All that was harsh and hostile,
   has turned into sublime delight.
   When music's enchantment reigns,
   speaking of the sacred word,
   Magnificence takes form,
   The night and the tempest turns to light:
   Outer peace and inner bliss
   Reign o'er the fortunate ones.
   All art in the spring's sun
   Lets light flow from both.
   Greatness, once it has pierced the heart,
   Then blooms anew in all its beauty.
   Once one's being has taken flight,
   A choir of spirits resounds in response.
   Accept then, you beautiful souls,
   Joyously the gifts of high art.
   When love and strength are united,
   Divine grace is bestowed upon Man.^[10]

   The piece ends with repetition of phrases from the last four lines.

   As noted above, the words were written in haste, and Beethoven was
   perhaps not entirely pleased with them. He later wrote to his publisher
   Breitkopf & Härtel:

     You may wish to print another text, as the text like the music was
     written very quickly ... Still with another set of words I want the
     word kraft ["strength"] to be kept or one similar to it in its
     place.

   As Kalischer et al. observe, the word Kraft "is treated with grand
   style in the music."^[11]

   A new German text was written by a German poet and Communist politician
   Johannes R. Becher in 1951, keeping the word Kraft in the same
   position. Becher's text, inspired by Beethoven's explicit permission to
   change the lyrics, is an ode to peace that reflects the post-war
   atmosphere. Becher's lyrics were used in several recordings especially
   in East Germany, for example those of Franz Konwitschny or Herbert
   Kegel.^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]

   The Fantasy for piano, vocal soloists, mixed chorus, and orchestra,
   Op. 80, usually called the Choral Fantasy, was composed in 1808 by then
   38-year-old Ludwig van Beethoven.

   Beethoven intended the Fantasy to serve as the concluding work for the
   benefit concert he put on for himself on 22 December 1808; the
   performers consisted of vocal soloists, mixed chorus, an orchestra, and
   Beethoven himself as piano soloist. The Fantasy was designed to include
   all the participants in the program and thus unites all of these
   musical forces.

   The work is noted as a precursor to the later Ninth Symphony.

Background, composition, and premiere

   [edit]

   The Fantasia was first performed at the Akademie of 22 December 1808, a
   benefit concert which also saw the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth
   Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto as well as a performance of
   excerpts of the Mass in C major. To conclude this memorable concert
   program, Beethoven wanted a "brilliant finale" that would unite in a
   single piece the different musical elements highlighted in the concert
   night: piano solo, mixed chorus and orchestra. The Fantasia, Op. 80,
   written shortly before, was thus composed expressly to fulfil this
   role. Beethoven himself played the piano part and the opening solo
   offers an example of his improvisational style (at the premiere he did,
   in fact, improvise this section).

   Beethoven wrote the piece during the second half of December 1808 in an
   unusually short time by his standards. He commissioned a poet—whose
   identity is disputed—to write the words shortly before the performance
   to fit the already written parts. According to Beethoven's pupil Carl
   Czerny, the poet was Christoph Kuffner [de],^[1] but the later
   Beethoven scholar Gustav Nottebohm doubted this attribution and
   suggested it may have been Georg Friedrich Treitschke, who in 1814
   prepared the final text of Beethoven's opera Fidelio.^[2]

   The premiere performance seems to have been a rather troubled one;
   according to the composer's secretary, Anton Schindler, it "simply fell
   apart", a result most likely attributable to insufficient rehearsal
   time. Because of a mistake in the execution of the piece, it was
   stopped halfway through and restarted.^[3] In Ignaz von Seyfried's
   words:^[4]^[5]

     When the master brought out his orchestral Fantasia with choruses,
     he arranged with me at the somewhat hurried rehearsal, with wet^[6]
     voice-parts as usual, that the second variation should be played
     without repeat. In the evening, however, absorbed in his creation,
     he forgot all about the instructions which he had given, repeated
     the first part while the orchestra accompanied the second, which
     sounded not altogether edifying. A trifle too late, the
     Concertmaster, Unrath, noticed the mistake, looked in surprise at
     his lost companions, stopped playing and called out dryly: 'Again!'
     A little displeased, the violinist Anton Wranitzky asked 'With
     repeats?' 'Yes', came the answer, and now the thing went straight as
     a string.

The Choral Fantasy and the Ninth Symphony

   [edit]

   The work includes a sequence of variations on a theme that is widely
   felt to be an early version of a far better known variation theme,
   namely the one to which Beethoven set the words of Friedrich Schiller's
   "Ode to Joy" in his Ninth Symphony. The two themes are compared below.

   Michael Broyles has suggested another musical similarity: the two works
   share essentially the same harmonic sequence at their climactic
   moments, the chords (in C major) C–F–D–(G)–E♭, where the E♭ stands out
   from its harmonic context and is performed fortissimo. The words sung
   at this point are (for the Choral Fantasy) "Lieb und Kraft" ("love and
   strength") and (for the Ninth Symphony) "Über'm Sternenzelt! Über
   Sternen muss er wohnen." ("Above the tent of the stars, above the stars
   he must dwell.")^[7]

   There are also affinities in the texts. The theme of the Choral Fantasy
   text – universal fraternity with the meeting of arts – evokes similar
   feelings as the "Ode to Joy" text.

   Beethoven himself acknowledged the kinship of the two works. In a
   letter of 1824, when he was writing the Ninth Symphony, he described
   his project as "a setting of the words of Schiller's immortal 'Lied an
   die Freude' in the same way as my pianoforte fantasia with chorus, but
   on a far grander scale."^[8]

   The Choral Fantasy theme is itself taken from an earlier work by
   Beethoven: it is a slightly modified version of the composer's "Seufzer
   eines Ungeliebten – Gegenliebe,” a lied for high voice and piano
   written c. 1794–1795.^[9]

   and the Washtenaw Community Orchestra Chorus in 2009

   The Choral Fantasy, which lasts about twenty minutes, is divided into
   two movements, played without a break:
    1. Adagio
    2. Finale. Allegro – Meno allegro (Allegretto) – Allegro molto –
       Adagio ma non troppo – Marcia, assai vivace – Allegro – Allegretto
       ma non troppo quasi andante con moto Schmeichelnd hold und lieblich
       klingen – Presto

   The piece is scored for solo piano, mixed chorus, two soprano soloists,
   an alto soloist, two tenor soloists, a bass soloist, and an orchestra
   consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two
   horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

   The Fantasy opens with a slow but virtuosic 26-bar piano introduction,
   beginning in C minor and modulating through a variety of keys in
   florid, improvisatory fashion. At its midpoint it settles on the
   dominant of the dominant, G major, with an extended cadenza. The
   implied key is never confirmed and the music eventually returns to C
   minor in a stormy passage, which at the last moment turns once more
   toward the dominant seventh of G in a sweeping arpeggio. This concludes
   the opening section.

   The main part of the piece, marked "Finale", begins with a march-like
   motive (Allegro) played by the cellos and basses, alternating with
   recitative-like interjections from the piano. The music eventually
   brightens into C major and the solo piano introduces the principal
   theme (meno allegro) discussed above. Variations on the theme are then
   played by gradually increasing contingents of instruments: a solo
   flute, two oboes, a trio of two clarinets and bassoon, and string
   quartet. A full orchestral version of the theme played at a forte
   dynamic leads to the re-entry of the piano and to what seems at first
   like a postlude to this variation set, but that once again turns toward
   the dominant. The music pauses with a cadenza on the dominant seventh
   for the solo piano.

   There is an abrupt change of mood as the minor mode returns in a stormy
   Allegro molto. The alternating phrases for piano and orchestra are a
   disguised variation of the principal theme. In fact, the three sections
   that follow the first variation set form another, larger-scale set of
   variations. The allegro molto soon takes on a developmental quality
   with a series of modulations, the strings playing phrases of the theme
   accompanied by rapid broken chords on the solo piano. After another
   cadenza on an E major triad the second large variation (Adagio, ma non
   troppo) follows, a calm, flowing A major section prominently featuring
   the clarinets. This ends with a call-and-response section between
   double reeds, horn, and piano, and leads without break into the key of
   F major and the third variation on the main theme, Marcia (assai
   vivace). A reprise of the instrumental theme from the first Allegro
   forms the transition into the choral finale (Allegretto).

   The first half of this is essentially a recapitulation of previously
   heard material at the beginning of the Finale with the addition of solo
   voices and chorus, another point of similarity with the finale of the
   Ninth Symphony. After a prolonged dominant pedal and arpeggios from the
   soloist the chorus, two solo sopranos sing the main theme, followed by
   a variation featuring a trio of men's voices. After these two
   variations the entire chorus is joined by the orchestra for the first
   time in a tutti rendition of the theme. The music gains excitement and
   eventually breaks into an accelerated coda (Presto) with all forces
   joining to bring the piece to a triumphant close.

Text

   [edit]

   Schmeichelnd hold und lieblich klingen
   unseres Lebens Harmonien,
   und dem Schönheitssinn entschwingen
   Blumen sich, die ewig blühn.
   Fried und Freude gleiten freundlich
   wie der Wellen Wechselspiel.
   Was sich drängte rauh und feindlich,
   ordnet sich zu Hochgefühl.
   Wenn der Töne Zauber walten
   und des Wortes Weihe spricht,
   muss sich Herrliches gestalten,
   Nacht und Stürme werden Licht.
   Äuß're Ruhe, inn're Wonne
   herrschen für den Glücklichen.
   Doch der Künste Frühlingssonne
   läßt aus beiden Licht entstehn.
   Großes, das ins Herz gedrungen,
   blüht dann neu und schön empor.
   Hat ein Geist sich aufgeschwungen,
   hallt ihm stets ein Geisterchor.
   Nehmt denn hin, ihr schönen Seelen,
   froh die Gaben schöner Kunst
   Wenn sich Lieb und Kraft vermählen,
   lohnt den Menschen Göttergunst.^[10]

   Graceful, charming and sweet is the sound
   Of our life's harmonies,
   and from a sense of beauty arise
   Flowers which eternally bloom.
   Peace and joy advance in perfect concord,
   like the changing play of the waves.
   All that was harsh and hostile,
   has turned into sublime delight.
   When music's enchantment reigns,
   speaking of the sacred word,
   Magnificence takes form,
   The night and the tempest turns to light:
   Outer peace and inner bliss
   Reign o'er the fortunate ones.
   All art in the spring's sun
   Lets light flow from both.
   Greatness, once it has pierced the heart,
   Then blooms anew in all its beauty.
   Once one's being has taken flight,
   A choir of spirits resounds in response.
   Accept then, you beautiful souls,
   Joyously the gifts of high art.
   When love and strength are united,
   Divine grace is bestowed upon Man.^[10]

   The piece ends with repetition of phrases from the last four lines.

   As noted above, the words were written in haste, and Beethoven was
   perhaps not entirely pleased with them. He later wrote to his publisher
   Breitkopf & Härtel:

     You may wish to print another text, as the text like the music was
     written very quickly ... Still with another set of words I want the
     word kraft ["strength"] to be kept or one similar to it in its
     place.

   As Kalischer et al. observe, the word Kraft "is treated with grand
   style in the music."^[11]

   A new German text was written by a German poet and Communist politician
   Johannes R. Becher in 1951, keeping the word Kraft in the same
   position. Becher's text, inspired by Beethoven's explicit permission to
   change the lyrics, is an ode to peace that reflects the post-war
   atmosphere. Becher's lyrics were used in several recordings especially
   in East Germany, for example those of Franz Konwitschny or Herbert
   Kegel.^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]

   Performers  Ludwig van Beethoven (piano)

   The Fantasy for piano, vocal soloists, mixed chorus, and orchestra,
   Op. 80, usually called the Choral Fantasy, was composed in 1808 by then
   38-year-old Ludwig van Beethoven.

   Beethoven intended the Fantasy to serve as the concluding work for the
   benefit concert he put on for himself on 22 December 1808; the
   performers consisted of vocal soloists, mixed chorus, an orchestra, and
   Beethoven himself as piano soloist. The Fantasy was designed to include
   all the participants in the program and thus unites all of these
   musical forces.

   The work is noted as a precursor to the later Ninth Symphony.

Background, composition, and premiere

   [edit]

   The Fantasia was first performed at the Akademie of 22 December 1808, a
   benefit concert which also saw the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth
   Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto as well as a performance of
   excerpts of the Mass in C major. To conclude this memorable concert
   program, Beethoven wanted a "brilliant finale" that would unite in a
   single piece the different musical elements highlighted in the concert
   night: piano solo, mixed chorus and orchestra. The Fantasia, Op. 80,
   written shortly before, was thus composed expressly to fulfil this
   role. Beethoven himself played the piano part and the opening solo
   offers an example of his improvisational style (at the premiere he did,
   in fact, improvise this section).

   Beethoven wrote the piece during the second half of December 1808 in an
   unusually short time by his standards. He commissioned a poet—whose
   identity is disputed—to write the words shortly before the performance
   to fit the already written parts. According to Beethoven's pupil Carl
   Czerny, the poet was Christoph Kuffner [de],^[1] but the later
   Beethoven scholar Gustav Nottebohm doubted this attribution and
   suggested it may have been Georg Friedrich Treitschke, who in 1814
   prepared the final text of Beethoven's opera Fidelio.^[2]

   The premiere performance seems to have been a rather troubled one;
   according to the composer's secretary, Anton Schindler, it "simply fell
   apart", a result most likely attributable to insufficient rehearsal
   time. Because of a mistake in the execution of the piece, it was
   stopped halfway through and restarted.^[3] In Ignaz von Seyfried's
   words:^[4]^[5]

     When the master brought out his orchestral Fantasia with choruses,
     he arranged with me at the somewhat hurried rehearsal, with wet^[6]
     voice-parts as usual, that the second variation should be played
     without repeat. In the evening, however, absorbed in his creation,
     he forgot all about the instructions which he had given, repeated
     the first part while the orchestra accompanied the second, which
     sounded not altogether edifying. A trifle too late, the
     Concertmaster, Unrath, noticed the mistake, looked in surprise at
     his lost companions, stopped playing and called out dryly: 'Again!'
     A little displeased, the violinist Anton Wranitzky asked 'With
     repeats?' 'Yes', came the answer, and now the thing went straight as
     a string.

The Choral Fantasy and the Ninth Symphony

   [edit]

   The work includes a sequence of variations on a theme that is widely
   felt to be an early version of a far better known variation theme,
   namely the one to which Beethoven set the words of Friedrich Schiller's
   "Ode to Joy" in his Ninth Symphony. The two themes are compared below.

   Michael Broyles has suggested another musical similarity: the two works
   share essentially the same harmonic sequence at their climactic
   moments, the chords (in C major) C–F–D–(G)–E♭, where the E♭ stands out
   from its harmonic context and is performed fortissimo. The words sung
   at this point are (for the Choral Fantasy) "Lieb und Kraft" ("love and
   strength") and (for the Ninth Symphony) "Über'm Sternenzelt! Über
   Sternen muss er wohnen." ("Above the tent of the stars, above the stars
   he must dwell.")^[7]

   There are also affinities in the texts. The theme of the Choral Fantasy
   text – universal fraternity with the meeting of arts – evokes similar
   feelings as the "Ode to Joy" text.

   Beethoven himself acknowledged the kinship of the two works. In a
   letter of 1824, when he was writing the Ninth Symphony, he described
   his project as "a setting of the words of Schiller's immortal 'Lied an
   die Freude' in the same way as my pianoforte fantasia with chorus, but
   on a far grander scale."^[8]

   The Choral Fantasy theme is itself taken from an earlier work by
   Beethoven: it is a slightly modified version of the composer's "Seufzer
   eines Ungeliebten – Gegenliebe,” a lied for high voice and piano
   written c. 1794–1795.^[9]

   and the Washtenaw Community Orchestra Chorus in 2009

   The Choral Fantasy, which lasts about twenty minutes, is divided into
   two movements, played without a break:
    1. Adagio
    2. Finale. Allegro – Meno allegro (Allegretto) – Allegro molto –
       Adagio ma non troppo – Marcia, assai vivace – Allegro – Allegretto
       ma non troppo quasi andante con moto Schmeichelnd hold und lieblich
       klingen – Presto

   The piece is scored for solo piano, mixed chorus, two soprano soloists,
   an alto soloist, two tenor soloists, a bass soloist, and an orchestra
   consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two
   horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

   The Fantasy opens with a slow but virtuosic 26-bar piano introduction,
   beginning in C minor and modulating through a variety of keys in
   florid, improvisatory fashion. At its midpoint it settles on the
   dominant of the dominant, G major, with an extended cadenza. The
   implied key is never confirmed and the music eventually returns to C
   minor in a stormy passage, which at the last moment turns once more
   toward the dominant seventh of G in a sweeping arpeggio. This concludes
   the opening section.

   The main part of the piece, marked "Finale", begins with a march-like
   motive (Allegro) played by the cellos and basses, alternating with
   recitative-like interjections from the piano. The music eventually
   brightens into C major and the solo piano introduces the principal
   theme (meno allegro) discussed above. Variations on the theme are then
   played by gradually increasing contingents of instruments: a solo
   flute, two oboes, a trio of two clarinets and bassoon, and string
   quartet. A full orchestral version of the theme played at a forte
   dynamic leads to the re-entry of the piano and to what seems at first
   like a postlude to this variation set, but that once again turns toward
   the dominant. The music pauses with a cadenza on the dominant seventh
   for the solo piano.

   There is an abrupt change of mood as the minor mode returns in a stormy
   Allegro molto. The alternating phrases for piano and orchestra are a
   disguised variation of the principal theme. In fact, the three sections
   that follow the first variation set form another, larger-scale set of
   variations. The allegro molto soon takes on a developmental quality
   with a series of modulations, the strings playing phrases of the theme
   accompanied by rapid broken chords on the solo piano. After another
   cadenza on an E major triad the second large variation (Adagio, ma non
   troppo) follows, a calm, flowing A major section prominently featuring
   the clarinets. This ends with a call-and-response section between
   double reeds, horn, and piano, and leads without break into the key of
   F major and the third variation on the main theme, Marcia (assai
   vivace). A reprise of the instrumental theme from the first Allegro
   forms the transition into the choral finale (Allegretto).

   The first half of this is essentially a recapitulation of previously
   heard material at the beginning of the Finale with the addition of solo
   voices and chorus, another point of similarity with the finale of the
   Ninth Symphony. After a prolonged dominant pedal and arpeggios from the
   soloist the chorus, two solo sopranos sing the main theme, followed by
   a variation featuring a trio of men's voices. After these two
   variations the entire chorus is joined by the orchestra for the first
   time in a tutti rendition of the theme. The music gains excitement and
   eventually breaks into an accelerated coda (Presto) with all forces
   joining to bring the piece to a triumphant close.

Text

   [edit]

   Schmeichelnd hold und lieblich klingen
   unseres Lebens Harmonien,
   und dem Schönheitssinn entschwingen
   Blumen sich, die ewig blühn.
   Fried und Freude gleiten freundlich
   wie der Wellen Wechselspiel.
   Was sich drängte rauh und feindlich,
   ordnet sich zu Hochgefühl.
   Wenn der Töne Zauber walten
   und des Wortes Weihe spricht,
   muss sich Herrliches gestalten,
   Nacht und Stürme werden Licht.
   Äuß're Ruhe, inn're Wonne
   herrschen für den Glücklichen.
   Doch der Künste Frühlingssonne
   läßt aus beiden Licht entstehn.
   Großes, das ins Herz gedrungen,
   blüht dann neu und schön empor.
   Hat ein Geist sich aufgeschwungen,
   hallt ihm stets ein Geisterchor.
   Nehmt denn hin, ihr schönen Seelen,
   froh die Gaben schöner Kunst
   Wenn sich Lieb und Kraft vermählen,
   lohnt den Menschen Göttergunst.^[10]

   Graceful, charming and sweet is the sound
   Of our life's harmonies,
   and from a sense of beauty arise
   Flowers which eternally bloom.
   Peace and joy advance in perfect concord,
   like the changing play of the waves.
   All that was harsh and hostile,
   has turned into sublime delight.
   When music's enchantment reigns,
   speaking of the sacred word,
   Magnificence takes form,
   The night and the tempest turns to light:
   Outer peace and inner bliss
   Reign o'er the fortunate ones.
   All art in the spring's sun
   Lets light flow from both.
   Greatness, once it has pierced the heart,
   Then blooms anew in all its beauty.
   Once one's being has taken flight,
   A choir of spirits resounds in response.
   Accept then, you beautiful souls,
   Joyously the gifts of high art.
   When love and strength are united,
   Divine grace is bestowed upon Man.^[10]

   The piece ends with repetition of phrases from the last four lines.

   As noted above, the words were written in haste, and Beethoven was
   perhaps not entirely pleased with them. He later wrote to his publisher
   Breitkopf & Härtel:

     You may wish to print another text, as the text like the music was
     written very quickly ... Still with another set of words I want the
     word kraft ["strength"] to be kept or one similar to it in its
     place.

   As Kalischer et al. observe, the word Kraft "is treated with grand
   style in the music."^[11]

   A new German text was written by a German poet and Communist politician
   Johannes R. Becher in 1951, keeping the word Kraft in the same
   position. Becher's text, inspired by Beethoven's explicit permission to
   change the lyrics, is an ode to peace that reflects the post-war
   atmosphere. Becher's lyrics were used in several recordings especially
   in East Germany, for example those of Franz Konwitschny or Herbert
   Kegel.^[12]^[13]^[14]^[15]
