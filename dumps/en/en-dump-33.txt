Coraline: A Fun, Eerie Read

   Spoilers! I really enjoyed this book! At 30,826 words I think it makes
   more sense to call it a novella than a short story. I think my
   favourite aspect of Gaiman’s writing in this work is the tone (I’m now
   on my third Gaiman book, and that seems to be one of his foremost

   Alexander, Taran begins his quest to learn his parentage with a great
   deal of pride. His pride has always manifested itself in the series as
   quickness to judge others, accumulated shame regarding his own
   mistakes, and a high value on birth, nobility, andContinue reading “At
