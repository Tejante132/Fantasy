Top 10 Fantasy Book Series

   My Inspirations
   6 Apr
   Written By Dominic Merrick

   Here is my list of favourite fantasy series. This list will not include
   a number of things. As with every list, this comes with a preface that
   these are my PERSONAL choices, completely idiosyncratic, with all my
   biases.
     * No singular books. For example The Broken Sword by Poul Anderson
       (one of the greats) as it has no books preceding or following.

     * Can include series that are not finished. When they have an ending,
       the positions may also change if they are satisfactory or not.

Honourable Mentions

   Grimm’s Fairytales, Arabian Nights, Le Morte D’Arthur by Thomas
   Mallory, His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman, The Fionavar Tapestry by
   Guy Gavriel Kay, The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe, The Chronicles
   of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever by Stephen R Donaldson, Viroconium by
   M John Harrison, The Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper, The Long Price
   Quartet by Daniel Abraham, Sandman by Neil Gaiman and The Black Company
   by Glenn Cook.

Detailed Honourable Mentions

   The Witcher by Andzrej Sapkowski - layered and memorable characters.
   The first two books are top class - short story collections. The author
   thrives in the short story, my favourite being Shard of Ice. When the
   series becomes a tetralogy, the story sags, jumping around places and
   people that I had no care or interest for. When it focuses on the main
   characters it excels. The best of the five after the first two short
   story collections is Baptism of Fire which showcases Sapkowski’s best
   character writing.

   The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny - really great concept and the
   plot is wild. It has some super world-building ideas and some of the
   most outlandish moments in fantasy. However, it suffers from mid-series
   lag, repetition of ideas and the characters are not so strong.

   Memory, Sorrow, Thorn by Tad Williams - classic with enough of a twist
   to make it different. The influences bleed out of this series, and it
   is steeped in fantasy tradition which is both a benefit and a downfall.
   It is saggy in many parts, including the first 200 pages of the first
   book, which is usually a fatal error. The prose is very strong and the
   cultures are interesting - ranging from Native American inspired to
   Norse.

   The Belgariad by David Eddings - a really formative series for me full
   of evocative ideas. The Grolim Priesthood who have purple or green
   lining on their hoods to delineate their rank, the cursed Red Murgo
   Gold, the Disciples of Torak who rule from different cities in the
   country. All of the evil dudes in this series are interesting. The good
   guys become caricatures after a couple of books, with the exception of
   Polgara the Sorceress who is the standout character, a stern, stubborn,
   cold yet protective witch. It is definitely something that suffers on a
   reread. I have fond nostalgia for this series.

   Cthulhu Mythos by HP Lovecraft - one of the grandfathers. It is hugely
   inspiring. I feel almost compelled to put it on the list, but I can’t
   for the fact that almost every story is difficult to read, there are no
   characters to enjoy and most are not likeable in both their personality
   and worldview. It is the atmosphere of terror and startling originality
   that are almost enough to get it on the list.

   The First Law by Joe Abercrombie - Fantastic characters but a fairly
   so-so world. Glokta the Crippled Torturer stands head and shoulders
   above all others. The plot is sometimes intriguing, sometimes
   predictable. The strongest standalone book for me is Red Country, a
   blend of fantasy and western, but nothing tops the First Law Trilogy so
   far. I met Mr Abercrombie for a book signing and he was a funny dude,
   he also helped with a research project I did at university. He is the
   first experience I had with ‘grimdark’ and probably the best with the
   exception of number 10 on this list.

NOW FINALLY FOR THE TOP 10

A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin

   So, maybe not a good start to include a series that is not yet
   finished, but the first three books are some of my favourite in
   fantasy. The world is vast and fantastically internally consistent, the
   plot is intricate and complex with so many brilliant twists that you
   wish you saw coming but you didn’t.

   The best thing about this series is the characters, Tyrion the Dwarf,
   Jon Snow the Bastard of the Night’s Watch, Daenerys the Exiled Princess
   and so many more.

   Best book - A Storm of Swords (#3)

The Dying Earth by Jack Vance

   These fix-ups really blew my mind. It includes The Dying Earth, Eyes of
   the Overworld, Cudgel’s Saga and Rhialto the Marvellous. The first book
   is from the 50s, the second from the 60s, and the last two from the
   80s. In my opinion the collection of short stories within the first
   book are the strongest, so wild in their imagination. They are about
   wizards scheming for power, with the backdrop of our dying planet so
   far into the future, that it is basically unrecognisable. The
   characters are mostly cutouts save for Cudgel the Clever.

   It is a huge influence on my writing, one of the best settings every
   created, purple prose, wacky ideas with a dark gloomy atmosphere
   clashing against a witty writer and quirky characters.

   Best book - The Dying Earth (#1)

8

Conan The Barbarian by Robert E Howard

   A short story ‘collection’, actually just a mammoth series of short
   stories, dozens and dozens. They usually concern fading or failing
   societies that Conan encounters on his travels, dark fairytales without
   a moral. Conan himself is iconic, a cunning barbarian who fears magic,
   sleeping with many woman and carving a kingdom for himself in a cruel
   world.

   The setting is dark, the ideas are ballsy, the pacing is full on action
   with very few moments of respite, and surprisingly many of the stories
   stand the test of time (though not for modern values).

   Best Book - Queen of the Black Coast and Red Nails, two novella length
   tales.

7

The Eternal Champion Series by Michael Moorcock

   A rather large series of disparate and disorganised chronology, one
   that encompasses many short story collections, novellas and a few
   novels (though short). Elric of Melnibone is probably the best
   character, but I personally prefer the stories of Corum. He’s a member
   of an elder race struggling to fight with and against humans and the
   gods of chaos.

   These are evocative stories drawing from many interesting mythologies,
   Irish, Buddhist, Norse and so on. They all have that feeling of a lost
   legend in a time, an epic story within a world of stories. The series
   has so many iconic titular characters. Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon, Jerry
   Cornelius, Michael Kane and Erekosé.

   The series has a revolutionary idea in fantasy, that existence is
   divided into two factions, LAW and CHAOS. And this has stuck with me
   throughout my writing career and bleeds into much of my work. Our hero
   fights for LAW, and is always a reincarnation of that Eternal Champion,
   who must stop the forces of CHAOS from dominating the universe.

   Best book - Knight of Swords (Swords of Corum #1)

6

Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser by Fritz Leiber

   These short stories and novellas inspired my fantasy series, The Three
   Lovers, more than any other book. They follow the adventures of the
   titular characters in a sprawling fantasy city (Lanhkmar) and all the
   surrounding lands.

   There is a really great relationship between the two main characters,
   Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Fafhrd is a hulking barbarian, the Gray
   Mouser is a thief/magician type. They are both witty, endearing and
   generally good-hearted, doing bad only to bad people. Usually the
   stories pit them against thieves guilds, wizards or monsters and send
   them to fantastical locations, towers that come alive, caves in the
   shape of skulls and so forth.

   It’s real old school sword & sorcery with a heart. It’s the only S&S
   that I’ve read with heart, most don’t have loveable characters. With
   Cudgel or Conan, you admire their derring-do, you don’t love them.

   Best Book - Swords Against Death (#2 ) The Bazaar of the Bizarre

5

The Dark Tower by Stephen King

   This series is the latest of my loves and jumps straight into the
   number 5 spot, despite having only read it last year. It blew me away,
   proof that something new can shake-up my top 10, kicking The Belgariad
   out.

   It really had everything, great plot, some of the strongest
   protagonists of all time, one of the most interesting and creative
   worlds in all fantasy, super twists and an unforgettable ending that
   keeps you thinking about it months after the fact. I can’t wait to go
   back and re-read the series, but I will wait a few years.

   It captured my heart and my imagination like no other series in recent
   years. Roland, Eddie and Susannah are some of the best characters in
   all fantasy fiction.

   It’s Stephen King at his wackiest and most creative, he throws
   everything into this series and I really do believe that it is his
   Magnum Opus, even after reading The Stand, It and many others.

   Best Book - Wizard And Glass (Dark Tower #4)

Discworld by Terry Pratchett

   Kind of cheating just to lump all of Discworld in as one series when it
   has so many series intertwined.

   The Guards, the Witches and Death could make my top 10 without the
   rest. DEATH is simply one of the greatest ever characters, a civil
   servant performing his morbid duties with the best of Pratchett’s
   humour and ramblings on morality.

   Comedy is the greatest asset of this series but don’t let that fool
   you, Pratchett understands how people work so well, from the lowest
   peasant to the highest king… he just gets it.

   Spanning continents and dozens of books, it’s difficult where to start,
   but whatever you do - don’t start from the beginning, for there
   Pratchett is weakest! Start with the Guards Guards!, Reaper Man or
   Witches Abroad. Or ignore more and start with whatever takes your
   fancy. As a teen I started with Going Postal and fell in love with it
   immediately.

   Best Book - Small Gods

3

Middle-earth by JRR Tolkien

   Lord of the Rings is the god of epic fantasy. Nothing has bettered it
   in terms of setting/world-building since its inception and I doubt they
   ever will.

   Of course it has aged, but in my opinion like a fine wine. For a new
   reader it is potentially a difficult read, with the sheer amount of
   poetry, history and “old-speak”. For me, all of this makes it better,
   it lends an opulence rarely present in other series.

   Its rising drama is grounded completely in the setting, its characters
   are legendary and deep (Gandalf, Gollum, Boromir, Sam, Frodo), its
   locations are more recognisable to me than many on our own Earth.
   Middle-Earth is the best secondary world ever created.

   The reason it’s not higher is because of the movies. I’d watched (and
   loved) the movies years before I’d read the books (with the exception
   of The Hobbit). This meant I couldn’t help but be influenced by the
   images of those films. This didn’t detract from the beautiful prose,
   nor the deep history, nor the amazing poetry, but it did detract from
   the drama and it did detract from the realisation and creation aspect
   that comes with being a reader… I didn’t create it in my mind first…
   Peter Jackson and the Weta creators did.

   Best Book - The Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)

2

The Lyonesse Trilogy by Jack Vance

   For most people this would be even more difficult to read than Lord of
   the Rings. The prose is purple, the description is sometimes overkill
   and the characters are not given grand arcs to revel in. They are who
   they are and that’s enough.

   What Vance created for me was a dream, lush and vivid. The places are
   forever lodged in my mind, the plot twists are sudden and surprising,
   the quasi-Arthurian mish-mash of history and myth is brilliant and
   the characters leap at you with wit.

   The story is a struggle between rival sorcerers, rival kingdoms,
   faeriekind and humankind and magic versus non-magic. It squishes all
   these ideas seamlessly into a grand tapestry with so many detours and
   side quests that you don’t know where it’s going.

   I’ve never come across something like it, so original in its approach,
   almost with a blatant disregard to storytelling norms, yet being
   grounded in European myth and fantasy so that it all works. Lyonesse is
   very difficult to describe, other than by saying it has everything you
   might recognise from European folklore but presented to you in a way
   you wouldn’t expect.

   Best Book - Suldrun’s Garden (#1)

The Earthsea Cycle by Ursula K Le Guin

   When I look to how I want my first fantasy series to be, I want it to
   be like Le Guin’s Earthsea.

   I want it to have something potent to say about the themes of life,
   death, time and stories and to do it with prose like her’s, in
   digestible tomes, not great door-stoppers.

   What Le Guin achieved, for me, is genius.

   I love all our POV characters, I feel for them, I watch them age over
   the books and feel their pains. The perspectives change superbly, the
   first from Ged, the second from Tenar, the third from Arren, the fourth
   from Tenar and others but aged. With each book we see our main
   characters from different perspectives. A brilliant narrative trick,
   especially when those main characters change so much from book to book.

   Her prose is my favourite, waxing and waning lyrically but with
   purpose, a not a word is wasted. The setting is brilliant, hundreds of
   islands filled with goat farmers, pirates, scattered kingdoms and a
   magic school. We are taken through Ged’s life, seen from different
   points of view and in different phases of power. He goes from young
   apprentice, to powerful master, to fading master and it is beautiful.

   I’ll leave the rest of my ramblings for a full review… but Earthsea is
   the Queen of Fantasy for me.

   Best Book - The Tombs of Atuan (#2)

   these ideas seamlessly into a grand tapestry with so many detours and
   side quests that you don’t know where it’s going.

   I’ve never come across something like it, so original in its approach,
   almost with a blatant disregard to storytelling norms, yet being
   grounded in European myth and fantasy so that it all works. Lyonesse is
   very difficult to describe, other than by saying it has everything you
   might recognise from European folklore but presented to you in a way
   you wouldn’t expect.

The Earthsea Cycle by Ursula K Le Guin

   When I look to how I want my first fantasy series to be, I want it to
   be like Le Guin’s Earthsea.

   I want it to have something potent to say about the themes of life,
   death, time and stories and to do it with prose like her’s, in
   digestible tomes, not great door-stoppers.

   What Le Guin achieved, for me, is genius.

   I love all our POV characters, I feel for them, I watch them age over
   the books and feel their pains. The perspectives change superbly, the
   first from Ged, the second from Tenar, the third from Arren, the fourth
   from Tenar and others but aged. With each book we see our main
   characters from different perspectives. A brilliant narrative trick,
   especially when those main characters change so much from book to book.

   Her prose is my favourite, waxing and waning lyrically but with
   purpose, a not a word is wasted. The setting is brilliant, hundreds of
   islands filled with goat farmers, pirates, scattered kingdoms and a
   magic school. We are taken through Ged’s life, seen from different
   points of view and in different phases of power. He goes from young
   apprentice, to powerful master, to fading master and it is beautiful.

   I’ll leave the rest of my ramblings for a full review… but Earthsea is
   the Queen of Fantasy for me.
