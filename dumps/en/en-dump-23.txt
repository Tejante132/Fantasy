CHONKS: 25 BIG Fantasy Books

   Posted bySpells and Spaceships1st Apr 202318th Feb 2024Posted
   inFeatures

   Hi all, today’s post is going to introduce you to the chonkosaurus, the
   chonkopottomus, the chonkodon. The thicc book you could use to
   neutralise an intruder. To wedge a bank vault open. To prop up the
   leaning tower of Pisa like sliding a beermat under a wonky table.

   These books are all 600 pages plus and if you order online, will be
   forced to wait around in your pyjamas for the beast to arrive (no
   that’s not what I call my delivery driver), such is its inability to
   fit through letter boxes or catflaps, or be wedged into a mailbox. Your
   other option is heading out to a book shop with a friend to help you
   carry it home.

   Some of the following books I have read myself, whilst many of them
   come recommended from the book community. These books are possibly the
   only things on earth to train both your mind and your physical strength
   at exactly the same time.

   Of course, there is one solution: audiobooks!

   I hope you enjoy looking through these chonky books. Follow your manual
   handling principles if attempting to pick one up…

   *please note – the page count may vary by the edition or format of the
   book. Page counts mostly based on paperback version.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Grace of Kings by Ken Liu – 640 pages

   L. L. MacRae: “I love how much this book shows us about human nature.
   About how history repeats. About trying to avoid mistakes of the past
   cause new ones to happen. About how it might not be enough for people
   to do better or have good intentions, but they try anyway. About
   changing your fate and making the best of what you have.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Battle Mage by Peter Flannery – 648 pages

   Thanks to Maryszkowe for the picture

   Blaise for Under The Radar SFF Books: “If you need a complete story on
   a epic scale, this is the book for you… I will be recommending this
   book for the rest of my days as a blogger”
     __________________________________________________________________

Gardens of the Moon by Steven Eriskon – 657 pages

   Tommye from The Fantasy Review: “Gardens of the Moon is one of the
   best fantasy books I have ever read. The world is rich and its history
   angry and proud. Steven Erikson’s first book in Malazan Book of the
   Fallen is a masterpiece.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Legacy of the Brightwash by Krystle Matar – 662 pages

   Rebecca Crunden: “As magical and mysterious as Carnival Row, as
   upsetting and filled with warning as 1984, as harrowing and
   heartbreaking as The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, as powerful and
   painful as V For Vendetta, and as dark and twisty as The Alienist,
   Brightwash honestly blew me away.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss – 662 pages

   Petrik Leo for Novel Notions: “It’s meticulous, brilliantly
   unputdownable, elegant, lyrical, and poetic. It’s evident how the
   fourteen years of revision and editing brought fruition to this
   absolutely marvelous result.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Malice – 672 pages

   Sam at The Book in Hand: “This book has made me care about the
   characters in a way no other writer has ever managed, and not just one
   or two of the lead characters. Every. Single. One. Of. Them. It has
   left me breathless, had me laughing out loud, scowling at the pages and
   damned near crying.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Dragonbone Chair – 672 pages

   FantasyBookReview: “This is epic fantasy, nearly 800 pages of it and it
   lasts the pace well. The Dragonbone Chair brings together all the
   elements that are found in many a fantasy book and re-produces them in
   a beautiful and endearing way.”

Royal Assassin – 675 pages (Assassin’s Quest is even bigger at 869 pages)

   Alex Nieves: “Wow what a followup and absolutely beautifully tragic
   story Robin Hobb has created here. Easily one of the best books I’ve
   read this year. Hobb improved on Assassin’s Apprentice in damn near
   every conceivable way with this entry. It’s full of great characters,
   tragic storylines, and absolutely gorgeous writing. The hype and praise
   is to be believed for this book, that was excellent.”

Theft of Swords – 691 pages

   Nils Shukla for The Fantasy Hive: “Theft of Swords really embodies the
   high fantasy genre, it includes organically likable characters and a
   world so wonderfully layered there is always more to uncover”
     __________________________________________________________________

Northern Wrath – 700 pages

   Alex at Spells & Spaceships (me!): “Well, this book has everything –
   and it really does. It’s both plot and character driven. It has revenge
   storylines. It has self discovery and redemption, sacrifice and
   adventure. It has family and friendship themes. Romance, loss and pure
   berserker brutality.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Jade Legacy – 713 pages

   Benedict, creator of the SFF Oasis: “It’s a book that is perfect in
   every way and surpasses the standard 5 star system. Every word has been
   placed down with thought as if there was a word limit and not single
   consonant or vowel could be wasted. Fonda has written something utterly
   brilliant here that everyone needs to experience.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Illborn – 713 pages

   Thanks to Sarah’s Book Nook for the image
   https://www.instagram.com/p/CDt09eIpf2i/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=

   Fiona Denton for Grimdark Magazine: “Although this is Jackson’s first
   novel it is a clearly established, believable world and Illborn feels
   like a small part of something massive. I am genuinely excited to
   explore this world further and expect great things from this series.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Shadow of What Was Lost – 736 pages

   David S for FanfiAddict: “The author interweaves converging plotlines
   seamlessly into a satisfying climax and an incredible epilogue that
   made me want to start reading the next novel almost immediately, which
   I did.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Empire of the Vampire – 736 pages

   Trin at Portable Magic: “Wow… Just… Wow! This book is everything I have
   been wanting from a vampire novel for YEARS! I am at a loss of what to
   say”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Lies of Locke Lamora – 752 pages

   Matt’s Fantasy Book Reviews: “This is a fantastic fantasy novel that I
   happily can say is in my “top 10”.
   I loved everything about this book. The characters are wonderfully
   written, the world is thoroughly enjoyable (even though it’s on a very
   small scale), the plot is extremely engaging, the twists are exciting
   and shocking, and the ending is fantastic.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Eleventh Cycle – 779 pages

   Nick Borelli at Out of This World SFF: “Eleventh Cycle is a book that
   can horrify you one minute and then touch every heartstring in your
   being the next. That’s an incredibly tricky thing to pull off but
   Ardalan does it like a skilled maestro. If you’re tired of getting
   spoon-fed the same predictable tropes in your fantasy books, you really
   should make this book your next read. It will challenge you in a way
   that not too many fantasy books dare to. And along the way you will be
   treated to some outstanding worldbuilding, egotistical gods, magical
   creatures born of nightmares, and some of the very best writing out
   there.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Legacy of Ash – 800 pages

   Isabelle at The Shaggy Shepherd: “Legacy of Ash is my first experience
   with Matthew Ward’s writing and I am blown away. His world-building,
   which was a big focus of this first book in this series, is amazing. It
   lays out both the setting as well as the class system in great detail.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Ember Blade – 824 pages

   James Bella-Vardon for Grimdark Magazine: “The quality of writing is
   extraordinary, holding its own with any literary novel while not using
   hard words for the sake of it. The character building and plot twists
   are divine. The Grimdark element is present throughout, with real
   consequences for each of the characters’ actions and there being no
   convenient quick fixes or sudden deus ex machina moments to dilute the
   suspense which is ratcheted up further with each page turned. Wooding’s
   world is also possessed of a magic which is soft but intensely deep and
   powerful, with far-reaching consequences.”
     __________________________________________________________________

A Game of Thrones – 816 pages

   Mark Lawrence: “

   I maintain that not only is Game of Thrones a brilliant read, it’s also
   an important one for the genre. It’s meaningful to talk about post-GRRM
   fantasy.

   For many people, indeed for a decent chunk of a whole. generation of
   fantasy authors, George RR Martin’s A Game of Thrones was a step change
   in the genre.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Priory of the Orange Tree – 848 pages

   James Tivendale for Grimdark Magazine: “The Priory of the Orange Tree
   is incredibly detailed, neatly composed and has more stunning
   set-pieces, outstanding moments and unexpected twists that most epic
   fantasy trilogies.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Master Artificer – 866 pages

   Traveling Cloak: “Master Artificer is an absolute home run of a sequel.
   Everything – from the magic, to the storylines, the world building, the
   emotion – is bigger and better than the first book, which was already
   incredibly epic in scope. Master Artificer was one of my favorite reads
   of 2022.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Of Darkness and Light – 912 pages

   Wolfmantula: “This thicc baby is JUICY and starts off full throttle
   putting you right into the thick of it! It’s action packed, intense,
   full of fury and rage, with perfectly timed humor. It has a gritty
   darkness to it, but above all else it has a message of hope, a perfect
   marriage of both dark and light fantasy that can only be described as
   GrimHeart.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Hands of the Emperor – 969 pages

   Alexandra Rowland: “It has a burning core of fierce righteousness and a
   belief that good people doing hard, thankless work can make the world
   BETTER…Please, please, please read this book. This is my favorite,
   favorite book. I have not had a favorite book in years, but this is
   it.”
     __________________________________________________________________

Dragon Mage – 986 pages

   PL Stuart for Before We Go Blog: “This book far exceeds the nominal
   five star rating, so no point in trying to assign it one here. The best
   compliment I can give Dragon Mage, by M.L. Spencer is: Dragon Mage is
   why I read, and love, epic fantasy.”
     __________________________________________________________________

The Way of Kings – 1007 pages

   Alicia at Shethereader: “I’m floored by how Sanderson deals with deep
   topics without coming across as preachy. The characters have a way of
   encountering questions in life that I myself contemplate. It’s
   unsettling. It’s commonly mentioned in reviews that mental health is a
   big focus in this book. That was impactful, but more so was I really
   caught up by the examination of life before death – journey before
   destination. It ripped open some philosophical questions that I’ve been
   trying very hard to ignore and threw my heart and soul under a
   microscope.’
     __________________________________________________________________

Ash: A Secret History – 1632 pages

   “The first thing that should probably be said about Ash: A Secret
   History is that it’s probably the apex of the epic fantasy genre – or
   at least, the best thing written in the genre since The Lord of the
   Rings” – Goodreads review from Wastrel

       Great post. I loved so many of the books/series on this list. The
       Ember Blade and the sequel are brilliant and I can’t wait for the
       final one to be published. There are a couple that I haven’t heard
       of though so I obviously need to check them out as you can never
       have too many huge books😃

   encountering questions in life that I myself contemplate. It’s
   unsettling. It’s commonly mentioned in reviews that mental health is a
   big focus in this book. That was impactful, but more so was I really
   caught up by the examination of life before death – journey before
   destination. It ripped open some philosophical questions that I’ve been
   trying very hard to ignore and threw my heart and soul under a
   microscope.’

Ash: A Secret History – 1632 pages

   “The first thing that should probably be said about Ash: A Secret
   History is that it’s probably the apex of the epic fantasy genre – or
   at least, the best thing written in the genre since The Lord of the
   Rings” – Goodreads review from Wastrel

       Great post. I loved so many of the books/series on this list. The
       Ember Blade and the sequel are brilliant and I can’t wait for the
       final one to be published. There are a couple that I haven’t heard
       of though so I obviously need to check them out as you can never
       have too many huge books😃
