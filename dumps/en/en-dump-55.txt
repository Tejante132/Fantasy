   Example Sentences for fantasy

Word History

   Etymology

   Noun

   Middle English fantasie, fantsy, fansey "the imagination as a faculty,
   mental image produced by this faculty, deluded notion, figment of the
   imagination, preference directed by caprice rather than reason,
   liking," borrowed from Anglo-French fantasie "imagination as a faculty,
   figment of the imagination, dizziness," borrowed from Late Latin
   phantasia "imagination as a faculty, mental image of something
   perceived physically, image evoked by a poet or orator, a thing
   imagined by someone sleeping or ill, delusion," going back to Latin,
   "imagined situation or experience," borrowed from Greek phantasía
   "appearance, presentation to consciousness (whether immediate or in
   memory), image, imagination as a faculty, imagery," noun derivative
   corresponding to phantázein "to make visible, present to the eye or
   mind, (middle voice) place before one's mind, picture to oneself,
   imagine," causative verb from phantós "visible," verbal adjective of
   phaínō, phaínein (active voice) "to bring to light, cause to appear,"
   and phaínomai, phaínesthai (middle voice) "to become visible, come to
   light, appear," going back to *phan-i̯e/o-, thematized from
   Indo-European *b^h-né-h[2]-/b^h-n̥-h[2]- (whence also Armenian banam
   "(I) open, reveal"), nasal present from *b^heh[2]- "shine, give light,
   appear," whence Sanskrit bhā́ti "(it) shines, beams," Avestan
   fra-uuāiti "(it) beams forth"; the verb is allied to nominal
   derivatives in -n-, as Germanic *bōnjan- (whence Old English bōn
   "ornament," gebōned "ornamented," Middle Dutch boenen "to scrub,
   polish"), Old Irish bán "white, fair, bright," Tocharian B peñiyo
   "splendor," Sanskrit bhānú- "light, beam, brilliance, appearance,"
   Avestan bānu- "beam of light"

   Note: Compare fancy entry 2, in Middle English a rare variant of
   fantasie; the two split from each other in early Modern English, so
   that fancy entry 2 and fantasy now differ in meaning and construction.
   In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a not infrequent sense,
   usually with the spelling phantasy, was "the formation of images or
   representations in direct perception or in memory," more or less
   following the Greek meaning. — Regarding the relation of *b^heh[2]-
   "shine, give light, appear" to the homonymous base *b^heh[2]- "speak,
   say," see note at ban entry 1.

   Adjective

   from attributive use of fantasy entry 1

   Verb

   Middle English fantasien, fantesien, fancyen "to plan, devise, create,
   form (an idea), imagine (something false), desire" — more at fancy
   entry 1

   Note: The word was originally a variant of fancy entry 1, which,
   together with the more recent derivative fantasize, has in large part
   supplanted it.
   First Known Use

   Noun

   14th century, in the meaning defined at sense 6
