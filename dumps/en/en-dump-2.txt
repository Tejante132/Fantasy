   [Intro]
   Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
   Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
   Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
   I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy (Ooh, poor boy)
   Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
   Any way the wind blows (Ooh, the wind blows)
   Doesn't really matter to me, to me
   [Verse 1]
   Mama, just killed a man
   Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
   Mama, life had just begun
   But now I've gone and thrown it all away
   Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
   If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
   Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
   [Verse 2]
   Too late, my time has come
   Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
   Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
   Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
   Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
   I don't wanna die (Ooh)
   I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

   [Verse 3]
   I see a little silhouetto of a man
   Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
   Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
   (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro
   Magnifico (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
   But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
   He's just a poor boy from a poor family
   Spare him his life from this monstrosity
   Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
   Bismillah, no, we will not let you go (Let him go)
   Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let him go)
   Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let me go)
   Will not let you go (Let me go)
   (Never, never, never, never, never, never let me go) Will not let you
   go
   Oh-oh-oh-oh
   No, no, no, no, no, no, no
   Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia (Mamma mia, let me go)
   Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
   [Bridge]
   So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
   So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
   Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
   Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
   [Outro]
   (Ooh)
   (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
   Nothing really matters, anyone can see
   Nothing really matters
   Nothing really matters to me
   Any way the wind blows

   Song Bio (BUTTON) 20 contributors

   Widely considered to be one of the greatest songs of all time,
   “Bohemian Rhapsody” was the first single released from Queen’s fourth
   studio album, A Night at the Opera. It became an international success,
   reaching #1 in seven countries and peaking at #9 in the United States.
   On December 9, 1991, sixteen years after its initial release, “Bohemian
   Rhapsody” reclaimed #1 in the UK single charts after it was re-released
   by Queen as a double A-side single with “These Are the Days of Our
   Lives” two weeks after Freddie Mercury’s death on November 24, 1991. A
   year later in 1992, it re-entered the pop charts in the US, peaking at
   #2 after being featured in the hit movie Wayne’s World. In 2002, the
   song was listed at #1 in a Guinness World Records poll as Britain’s
   favourite single of all time—ranking higher than four Beatles tracks
   and “Imagine” by John Lennon. In 2004, the song was inducted into the
   Grammy Hall of Fame.

   The song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100, as well as public
   consciousness, yet again with the release of the Bohemian Rhapsody
   biopic in November of 2018. The movie grossed about $910.8 million
   worldwide, and made the song “the most streamed song of the 20th
   century” with over 1.6 billion downloads across all major streaming
   services. And on March 25, 2021, The Recording Industry Association of
   America (RIAA) certified Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” diamond.

   Complex and operatic both musically and lyrically, “Bohemian Rhapsody”
   (like Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and The Eagles‘ “Hotel
   California”) has attracted endless fan theories and commentary. The
   surviving band members have claimed that the narrative is based on the
   Faust legend; critics have found possible sources in opera and Freddie
   Mercury’s personal biography; but like any good piece of art, it’s open
   to interpretation.

   The word “Bohemian” seems to refer to a group of artists and musicians
   from the 19th century, known for defying convention and living with
   disregard for standards; as opposed to the region of Bohemia in the
   Czech Republic. Meanwhile the term “rhapsody” (derived from the Greek:
   ῥαψῳδός or rhapsōidos for a reciter of epic poetry, or a rhapsodist) is
   a piece of classical music with distinct sections that are played as
   one movement. Rhapsodies often feature dense themes or narratives.

   “Bohemian Rhapsody” has got a very diverse song structure. It includes:
   • Intro (0:00-0:49)
   • Ballad section (0:49-2:37)
   • Brian May‘s guitar solo (2:37-3:05)
   • Operatic verse (3:05-4:07)
   • Hard-rock verse (4:07-4:54)
   • Coda (4:54-5:55)

   A “bohemian” is an unconventional artistic free spirit who lacks
   anything tying them down. It can also refer to the Kingdom of Bohemia,
   now part of Czechia. It became associated with that sort of lifestyle
   because the French thought that was where travelling Romani communities
   came from.

   Was he gay? (BUTTON)
   Genius Answer

   “Objection, your Honor: context!” Re-phrase:

   In late 1975, when Bo Rap’s thunderbolts and lightning cast Queen as
   rock-gods, was Mercury struck as very, very openly gay?

   To “be gay”, or “not to be gay”, in mid-1970’s England, was that a
   question of psychiatric, legal, and/or religious ramifications? Mamma
   mia; “Spare him his life from” such monstrosities", right?

   Bo-Rap is a thrill ride shape-shifter, from tragic
   tear-jerk-trigger-pulling proportions to the comedically scary
   mock-opera trial parts. It took “Wayne’s World” to push on the gas of
   the thrill ride back up the U.S. charts to not-quite-#1. Before the
   snooty over-analysis to follow, let’s get one thing straight: this song
   has plenty of Bohemian comedy, so line up your opera spectacles (is
   “opera” gay?). And let’s not forget the B-side: Roger’s “I’m in Love
   With My Car”. Was he, then, motorosexual? Metrosexual? It’s all
   dripping in the metaphorical. Words, words, words, must be carefully
   chosen: ask Oscar Wilde or anyone accused of being heretical by the
   Papacy (scarier than reigning Queens, like certain … nevermind).

   Was Galileo imprisoned for his heliocentrism? Galileo Galilei was a
   Sheer Heretic, no? And if Dr. Brian May played the role of the 17th
   Century Astronomer, then who is Figaro, and were THEY straight? Was the
   earth flat? “Objection, your Honor!”

   Sustained; irreverent. Scaramouche, re-direct the “gay connotations”
   rotation annotation to the 20th to 21st century. Proceed:

   Many folks interpret Bo Rap’s lyrics as Mercury’s metaphoric struggle
   with his sexuality; Brian May and Roger Taylor have hinted at the
   viability of this “rap” regarding Freddie’s Bohemia.

   Mercury let these lyrics “be” open to interpretation. The song was a
   seedling as “The Cowboy Song”. That theme bit the dust ahead of time,
   but apparently left a smoking gun, anyway the wind blew pipes into
   Queen’s three singing members in mock-opera splendor, the antithesis of
   a “mute” court. Or was it an operatic jury from Hell passing judgment
   on the “love” that dare not speak its name?

   Freddie did say the song was about “relationships”; everyone can relate
   to that, regardless of “sexual preferences”.

   Sheila Whiteley co-authored a 2006 “book” of 19 essays about sexuality
   in popular music, “Queering the Popular Pitch” (Eds. Sheila Whiteley
   and Jennifer Rycenga, published by Routledge). Whiteley’s essay
   “Popular Music and the Dynamics of Desire” on page 252 provides an
   informative summary, albeit with a lyrical stretch,

     The heightened sense of urgency seems to resonate with Mercury’s
     inner turmoil, leaving the security of Mary Austin (who …remained
     a close friend throughout his life) coming to terms with gay life
     (“Easy come, easy go”), and living with a man (“So you think you can
     stone me and spit in my eye”). Mary was, however, more perceptive
     than the song implies. At the time, Freddie had asked her if she
     thought he was bisexual. Her reply—“I don’t think you’re bisexual. I
     think you’re gay” provides an insight into their relationship and
     her continuing support.

   When Queen’s gravitational pull grounded their megastardom around the
   globe, Freddie was not openly gay, i.e., he was not “out-of-the-closet”
   in a public way. An openly gay rock star, especially in the United
   States, would have been the kiss-of-death if the fate of New York
   City’s glam-rock overtly gay artist Jobriath gives any clue.

   Mary Austin was Freddie’s dearest friend and family-member, by default
   and design. His death is literally a testament to this. The Vintage
   News notes:

     Freddie Mercury’s will dictated that Mary was left with the better
     part of his wealth, more than $10 million, as well as his large
     mansion. His mother reportedly approved his decision, stating that
     Mary was like a family to her.

   Queen’s monetary health (especially Freddie’s) began with the success
   of Bo-Rap and their fourth album, “A Night at the Opera”. Such artistic
   and commercial acclaim made all of Queen’s men quite merry and GAY, and
   not merely because of the ensuing fame and pay, nor from relief at
   having severed the strings from their prior managers' greed, who
   allegedly swindled the band, so badly it spawned Mercury’s wrath on “A
   Night at the Opera”’s opening track, “Death on Two Legs (Dedicated
   to…)”.

   So was Freddie Mercury “gay”? Or was he “bi-sexual”? Is “Bohemian
   Rhapsody” his obvious “coming out” song? Did his “personal
   inclinations” have a creative impact on Queen’s music and performances
   for better or for worse? “Objection your honor!” Sustained. Queen still
   rules; Freddie sang his heart out for his fans, as much as he
   physically could, until the day he died. In the age of Freddie A.D.,
   the records have been set straight: Queen’s crown as the people’s band
   is legendary, transcending race, creed, identity, and the crazy little
   thing dubbed as a “rhapsody”? Labels. EMI (and Elektra?) didn’t approve
   of its release. But that’s a different story, and Freddie’s sexual
   “label” was a private, family matter to him, released or hidden in a
   metaphorical artistic sense?

   [Intro]
   Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
   Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
   Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
   I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy (Ooh, poor boy)
   Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
   Any way the wind blows (Ooh, the wind blows)
   Doesn't really matter to me, to me
   [Verse 1]
   Mama, just killed a man
   Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
   Mama, life had just begun
   But now I've gone and thrown it all away
   Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
   If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
   Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
   [Verse 2]
   Too late, my time has come
   Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
   Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
   Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
   Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
   I don't wanna die (Ooh)
   I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

   You might also like
   [Guitar Solo]
   [Verse 3]
   I see a little silhouetto of a man
   Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
   Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
   (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro
   Magnifico (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
   But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
   He's just a poor boy from a poor family
   Spare him his life from this monstrosity
   Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
   Bismillah, no, we will not let you go (Let him go)
   Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let him go)
   Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let me go)
   Will not let you go (Let me go)
   (Never, never, never, never, never, never let me go) Will not let you
   go
   Oh-oh-oh-oh
   No, no, no, no, no, no, no
   Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia (Mamma mia, let me go)
   Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
   [Bridge]
   So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
   So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
   Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
   Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
   [Outro]
   (Ooh)
   (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
   Nothing really matters, anyone can see
   Nothing really matters
   Nothing really matters to me
   Any way the wind blows

   Song Bio (BUTTON) 20 contributors

   Widely considered to be one of the greatest songs of all time,
   “Bohemian Rhapsody” was the first single released from Queen’s fourth
   studio album, A Night at the Opera. It became an international success,
   reaching #1 in seven countries and peaking at #9 in the United States.
   On December 9, 1991, sixteen years after its initial release, “Bohemian
   Rhapsody” reclaimed #1 in the UK single charts after it was re-released
   by Queen as a double A-side single with “These Are the Days of Our
   Lives” two weeks after Freddie Mercury’s death on November 24, 1991. A
   year later in 1992, it re-entered the pop charts in the US, peaking at
   #2 after being featured in the hit movie Wayne’s World. In 2002, the
   song was listed at #1 in a Guinness World Records poll as Britain’s
   favourite single of all time—ranking higher than four Beatles tracks
   and “Imagine” by John Lennon. In 2004, the song was inducted into the
   Grammy Hall of Fame.

   The song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100, as well as public
   consciousness, yet again with the release of the Bohemian Rhapsody
   biopic in November of 2018. The movie grossed about $910.8 million
   worldwide, and made the song “the most streamed song of the 20th
   century” with over 1.6 billion downloads across all major streaming
   services. And on March 25, 2021, The Recording Industry Association of
   America (RIAA) certified Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” diamond.

   Complex and operatic both musically and lyrically, “Bohemian Rhapsody”
   (like Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and The Eagles‘ “Hotel
   California”) has attracted endless fan theories and commentary. The
   surviving band members have claimed that the narrative is based on the
   Faust legend; critics have found possible sources in opera and Freddie
   Mercury’s personal biography; but like any good piece of art, it’s open
   to interpretation.

   The word “Bohemian” seems to refer to a group of artists and musicians
   from the 19th century, known for defying convention and living with
   disregard for standards; as opposed to the region of Bohemia in the
   Czech Republic. Meanwhile the term “rhapsody” (derived from the Greek:
   ῥαψῳδός or rhapsōidos for a reciter of epic poetry, or a rhapsodist) is
   a piece of classical music with distinct sections that are played as
   one movement. Rhapsodies often feature dense themes or narratives.

   “Bohemian Rhapsody” has got a very diverse song structure. It includes:
   • Intro (0:00-0:49)
   • Ballad section (0:49-2:37)
   • Brian May‘s guitar solo (2:37-3:05)
   • Operatic verse (3:05-4:07)
   • Hard-rock verse (4:07-4:54)
   • Coda (4:54-5:55)

   A “bohemian” is an unconventional artistic free spirit who lacks
   anything tying them down. It can also refer to the Kingdom of Bohemia,
   now part of Czechia. It became associated with that sort of lifestyle
   because the French thought that was where travelling Romani communities
   came from.

   Was he gay? (BUTTON)
   Genius Answer

   “Objection, your Honor: context!” Re-phrase:

   In late 1975, when Bo Rap’s thunderbolts and lightning cast Queen as
   rock-gods, was Mercury struck as very, very openly gay?

   To “be gay”, or “not to be gay”, in mid-1970’s England, was that a
   question of psychiatric, legal, and/or religious ramifications? Mamma
   mia; “Spare him his life from” such monstrosities", right?

   Bo-Rap is a thrill ride shape-shifter, from tragic
   tear-jerk-trigger-pulling proportions to the comedically scary
   mock-opera trial parts. It took “Wayne’s World” to push on the gas of
   the thrill ride back up the U.S. charts to not-quite-#1. Before the
   snooty over-analysis to follow, let’s get one thing straight: this song
   has plenty of Bohemian comedy, so line up your opera spectacles (is
   “opera” gay?). And let’s not forget the B-side: Roger’s “I’m in Love
   With My Car”. Was he, then, motorosexual? Metrosexual? It’s all
   dripping in the metaphorical. Words, words, words, must be carefully
   chosen: ask Oscar Wilde or anyone accused of being heretical by the
   Papacy (scarier than reigning Queens, like certain … nevermind).

   Was Galileo imprisoned for his heliocentrism? Galileo Galilei was a
   Sheer Heretic, no? And if Dr. Brian May played the role of the 17th
   Century Astronomer, then who is Figaro, and were THEY straight? Was the
   earth flat? “Objection, your Honor!”

   Sustained; irreverent. Scaramouche, re-direct the “gay connotations”
   rotation annotation to the 20th to 21st century. Proceed:

   Many folks interpret Bo Rap’s lyrics as Mercury’s metaphoric struggle
   with his sexuality; Brian May and Roger Taylor have hinted at the
   viability of this “rap” regarding Freddie’s Bohemia.

   Mercury let these lyrics “be” open to interpretation. The song was a
   seedling as “The Cowboy Song”. That theme bit the dust ahead of time,
   but apparently left a smoking gun, anyway the wind blew pipes into
   Queen’s three singing members in mock-opera splendor, the antithesis of
   a “mute” court. Or was it an operatic jury from Hell passing judgment
   on the “love” that dare not speak its name?

   Freddie did say the song was about “relationships”; everyone can relate
   to that, regardless of “sexual preferences”.

   Sheila Whiteley co-authored a 2006 “book” of 19 essays about sexuality
   in popular music, “Queering the Popular Pitch” (Eds. Sheila Whiteley
   and Jennifer Rycenga, published by Routledge). Whiteley’s essay
   “Popular Music and the Dynamics of Desire” on page 252 provides an
   informative summary, albeit with a lyrical stretch,

     The heightened sense of urgency seems to resonate with Mercury’s
     inner turmoil, leaving the security of Mary Austin (who …remained
     a close friend throughout his life) coming to terms with gay life
     (“Easy come, easy go”), and living with a man (“So you think you can
     stone me and spit in my eye”). Mary was, however, more perceptive
     than the song implies. At the time, Freddie had asked her if she
     thought he was bisexual. Her reply—“I don’t think you’re bisexual. I
     think you’re gay” provides an insight into their relationship and
     her continuing support.

   When Queen’s gravitational pull grounded their megastardom around the
   globe, Freddie was not openly gay, i.e., he was not “out-of-the-closet”
   in a public way. An openly gay rock star, especially in the United
   States, would have been the kiss-of-death if the fate of New York
   City’s glam-rock overtly gay artist Jobriath gives any clue.

   Mary Austin was Freddie’s dearest friend and family-member, by default
   and design. His death is literally a testament to this. The Vintage
   News notes:

     Freddie Mercury’s will dictated that Mary was left with the better
     part of his wealth, more than $10 million, as well as his large
     mansion. His mother reportedly approved his decision, stating that
     Mary was like a family to her.

   Queen’s monetary health (especially Freddie’s) began with the success
   of Bo-Rap and their fourth album, “A Night at the Opera”. Such artistic
   and commercial acclaim made all of Queen’s men quite merry and GAY, and
   not merely because of the ensuing fame and pay, nor from relief at
   having severed the strings from their prior managers' greed, who
   allegedly swindled the band, so badly it spawned Mercury’s wrath on “A
   Night at the Opera”’s opening track, “Death on Two Legs (Dedicated
   to…)”.

   So was Freddie Mercury “gay”? Or was he “bi-sexual”? Is “Bohemian
   Rhapsody” his obvious “coming out” song? Did his “personal
   inclinations” have a creative impact on Queen’s music and performances
   for better or for worse? “Objection your honor!” Sustained. Queen still
   rules; Freddie sang his heart out for his fans, as much as he
   physically could, until the day he died. In the age of Freddie A.D.,
   the records have been set straight: Queen’s crown as the people’s band
   is legendary, transcending race, creed, identity, and the crazy little
   thing dubbed as a “rhapsody”? Labels. EMI (and Elektra?) didn’t approve
   of its release. But that’s a different story, and Freddie’s sexual
   “label” was a private, family matter to him, released or hidden in a
   metaphorical artistic sense?
