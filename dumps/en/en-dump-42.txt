Fantasy music

   Below you'll find a huge range of royalty free music made by me. I'm
   not that great at it, so don't expect professionally crafted music, I'm
   still learning. But it is free to use, to some extent anyway. For more
   information on how you can and cannot use it, click here.
   I love creating music, so there will be more songs in the future,
   probably one every week.

   You can download my music on Soundcloud using the links below each
   song.

   A New Hunger

   A coldness descends from your neck down your entire body. With every
   breath you take you can feel the humanity leaving you. Your skin grows
   colder and whiter, you feel a creeping sensation in your mouth as fangs
   grow longer, and your heart pumps faster and faster in a frenzied panic
   until it stops beating at all. All that is left is a cold shell and an
   insatiable hunger for blood.
   [felineFamiliar.jpg]

   Abra-Cat-Abra

   Prey caught fresh and bowl of milk. Eye of newt and spider's silk. Brew
   for hours until mid-night, to fill it with a wondrous fright.
   [oni.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Adrenaline Rush

   The battle rages and the tides are in your favor. Enemy after enemy
   falls before your blade and wave after wave of adrenaline rushes
   through your vein as if waging a battle of their own.
   [phoenix.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]

   Anticipation

   Heart's racing, blood's pumping, adrenaline's coursing through every
   vein. Soon the moment of truth will be upon you, but all you can do for
   now is wait in anticipation.
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Approaching Hel

   The path to the dead is long and treacherous, but one that could be
   taken by both gods and mortals seeking to bring back a loved one from
   their untimely end. Yet the most dangerous part of all lies at the end
   of your journey: bargaining with Hel to reclaim the soul of your dearly
   departed.

   Arachne's Web

   A prey caught in a web, shadows move along its edges. Footsteps
   approach. Many, many footsteps. A huge creature emerges, half spider,
   half woman, followed by countless spiders both big and small. She
   welcomes her prey, clearly revelling in the prey's sticky situation.
   The prey knows its over, but not before Arachne's had her fun. It will
   be a long and agonizing end.

   Attack

   A song of the rush of adrenaline during battle, the drums of impending
   doom, and the looming grasp of death.
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Awaiting A Valkyrie

   The battle is fought and death was glorious. With ax in hand the
   valkyries will surely be upon you soon. Life was rough, but
   magnificent. The home you love will surely be missed, and those left
   behind might not all make it to Valhalla. The realization is bitter,
   but the Valkyries will bring you to the eternal halls as promised and
   within them you shall feast among the gods and all hurt and pain will
   be but a distant memory.

   Balance

   A song of inner peace, tranquility, and a sense of calm.

   [googleplay.png]

   Battle of Chiefs

   Power is everything to orcs and the only way to gain more is by
   defeating warchiefs for their share of it. Two chiefs enter, only one
   tends to leave, but everyone wins. The victor gains more power, the
   spectators a spectacle, and the defeated warchief gets to die honorably
   in a blaze of glory.
   [oni.jpg]

   [googleplay.png]

   Battle Rush

   As the battle rages on and the tides begin to turn evermore into your
   favor, the rush of adrenaline and fear turns to one of bloodlust and
   joy. This battle can be won, these enemies can be vanquished, you can
   destroy them all!
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Bifröst

   From far away the bifröst seems like a glimmering spectacle of a path
   fit only for the gods. You can only imagine what it must be like to
   traverse it. Moving further and further from home and deeper and deeper
   into the loneliness of space. But each step further away from home is a
   step closer to the gods, a step closer to the realm of glory and
   unimaginable magnificence. Perhaps one day you'll catch a glimpse of
   it.

   Bittersweet

   Everything comes to an end sooner or later, but few things leave us
   with a feeling of contentment when their end comes. The sadness of an
   end can overpower the feelings of joy and the precious memories we can
   still enjoy, and when we do enjoy those moments they're often
   bittersweet to say the least.
   [wendigo.jpg]

   Blood sacrifice

   A song of growing and growing chants, louder and louder drums, the
   impending doom of what awaits at the end.
   [phoenix.jpg]

   Breaking Through

   Two armies battle, soldier after soldier falls on both sides, and for a
   while it seems to be an even match. Adrenaline and fear dominate the
   battlefield, but particularly skilled, or perhaps simply lucky,
   soldiers manage to break up the ranks of their enemies. A chance for
   victory, fear is replaced with hope, hope of making it out alive, but
   the battle is far from over.

   Broken Cogs

   Life on the street is difficult even for an automaton. Without
   maintenance the elements gradually chip away at the little cogs and
   wheels within, and the lack of fresh oil prevents everything from
   moving as smoothly as it once did. The future looks most grim and
   uncertain at this hour.
   [arachne.jpg]

   Burn Down Their Homes

   Eye for an eye is the spider's motto and they've got plenty to spare.
   Over and over again they watched as humans burned down their webs and
   eradicated all traces of their homes. Now it's time to turn the tables
   and give those two-legged monsters what they deserve.
   [wendigo.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]
   [googleplay.png]

   Burn to Ashes

   The night horizon glows orange, a blazing fire rages in the distance.
   The torches of monsters set everything ablaze. Slowly the inferno
   creeps closer, burning everything in its path. Fields of crops, homes
   and villages, forests once lush and green, the livelihood and memories
   of countless people. Only soot and ash will remain.

   Caught in a web

   You're stuck. Twelve hellish furies, you're stuck. The more you move,
   the more you get yourself stuck in their tenacious webs. Stay calm and
   think for a moment, there must be a way out. Too late, they're coming.
   More and more of them, big ones, small ones, huge ones too. They're
   crawling all of you. Not a moment is wasted before they begin to wrap
   you in a cocoon. Hundreds of furry legs eagerly prepare you, their
   meal, and soon all that's left is a creepy darkness. The sounds of
   their crawling still audible through the cocoon, but that will end soon
   enough too.

   Carpet of Snow

   As you sit huddled up in a comfy chair by the crackling fire, a cup of
   body warming chocolate milk between your hands and your eyes staring
   through the window at the vast landscape beyond snow starts falling
   every so slightly at first. It doesn't take long before it intensifies
   and all the land becomes covered in a thick layer of fresh snow that
   lights up what seems like the entire world.

   Charge!

   The horns sound the incoming cavalry, the chaos of battle, and the
   turning of tides. More horns, incoming reinforcements. The tides turn
   again.

   A song inspired by the terrible feeling of being followed, but in a
   more dramatic and terrifying fashion.

   Children of the Forest

   Even in the deepest center of the elves' town, countless creatures dart
   and dash their way from branch to branch, bush to bush, and through
   homes and shops without a care in the world. The young elves take great
   pleasure in chasing the small forest bunnies, the young deer and the
   stumbling owlets. The older elves simply enjoy the spectacle from a
   hopefully safe distance.

   City of Monsters

   Deep within the darkest shadows exists a city of creatures unseen by
   most. Creatures big and small, furry and slimy, and everything in
   between, the city of monsters is home to all those who relish in the
   fear they strike in the hearts of men.
   [orc.jpg]

   Clashing Armies

   The horns of war echo through the air. Two armies charge for one
   another, and with a clash of swords, spears, shields, and screams they

   blood, countless arrows fly from one side to the other, and a stampede
   of a cavalry comes in from the side. The battle rages on, it's
   impossible to tell who will lose the most, but that's about the last
   thing on the minds of those caught in the midst of it.

   Company of Stars

   Endless space and an eternal darkness, yet around you is nothing but
   light from stars too distant to reach. They light your path as if
   inviting you to visit them, unfortunately you cannot. Your mission
   takes you elsewhere, though far away it still lies. But until you reach
   your destination, the company of stars is a one you gladly keep.

   Conquering Aegir

   One by one they creep and crawl
   Up your legs and up your wall
   Run you may, escape you can't

   In tiny legs you'll surely drown
   Surrounded now from floor to ceiling
   To the spider queen you will be kneeling

   Creatures In The Depths

   Crumbling City

   Sanded stones and wind beaten pillars of a once mighty wall now grant

   Metamorphosis

   You fight the urge to drink the blood of the innocent, but the more you
   fight, the more you feel a change within you. The thirst starts to
   manifest itself in the form of a true monster as your veins pulse with
   a creepy energy, one that immediately begins to change your very being.
   Your hands grow longer and gnarly, twisted claws grow from your finger
   nails. Your back arcs forward as two leathery wings sprout from
   nowhere. Your irises disappear as your eyes grow and turn milky, and
   your visage turns elongated and thin. This is your true vampiric form,
   the true monster within you.

   Moment of Solitude

   Once in a while a calm moment of reflection serves as a perfect way to
   clear your mind. Watching the world go by from a simple leaf drifting
   in the wind to the currents of a nearby creek take its waters to a sea
   far beyond the horizon, it's a great way to connect with the world and
   disconnect from whatever may trouble your mind at any given moment.

   Monkey Kingdom

   When the sun is out and the fruits are ripe, the monkey tribe hangs out

   As the sun sinks lower and lower behind the horizon, the forest grows
   darker and darker. It seems to go quiet, peaceful even as animals begin
   to prepare for their nightly slumber, but soon a whole different kind
   of life begins to awaken. As soon as the sun makes way for the moon,
   countless flowers open up and turn their crowns toward the sky.
   Nocturnal creatures of all sizes can be seen and heard all around, and
   the forest itself comes to life with a luminescent energy.

   New Beginnings

   What may start as a single, simple seed can grow into a vast oasis of

   race toward the light and spread their leaves to take full advantage of

   utmost importance and will determine whether these seedlings will join
   their ancient siblings high up in the canopy or whether they will

   A song inspired by the feeling of yearning for the past, for
   yesteryear. A bittersweet feeling. This version is an instrumental
   version, and thus without the vocal track.

Fantasy music

   Below you'll find a huge range of royalty free music made by me. I'm
   not that great at it, so don't expect professionally crafted music, I'm
   still learning. But it is free to use, to some extent anyway. For more
   information on how you can and cannot use it, click here.
   I love creating music, so there will be more songs in the future,
   probably one every week.

   You can download my music on Soundcloud using the links below each
   song.

   A New Hunger

   A coldness descends from your neck down your entire body. With every
   breath you take you can feel the humanity leaving you. Your skin grows
   colder and whiter, you feel a creeping sensation in your mouth as fangs
   grow longer, and your heart pumps faster and faster in a frenzied panic
   until it stops beating at all. All that is left is a cold shell and an
   insatiable hunger for blood.
   [felineFamiliar.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Abra-Cat-Abra

   Prey caught fresh and bowl of milk. Eye of newt and spider's silk. Brew
   for hours until mid-night, to fill it with a wondrous fright.
   [oni.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Adrenaline Rush

   The battle rages and the tides are in your favor. Enemy after enemy
   falls before your blade and wave after wave of adrenaline rushes
   through your vein as if waging a battle of their own.
   [phoenix.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]

   Anticipation

   Heart's racing, blood's pumping, adrenaline's coursing through every
   vein. Soon the moment of truth will be upon you, but all you can do for
   now is wait in anticipation.
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Approaching Hel

   The path to the dead is long and treacherous, but one that could be
   taken by both gods and mortals seeking to bring back a loved one from
   their untimely end. Yet the most dangerous part of all lies at the end
   of your journey: bargaining with Hel to reclaim the soul of your dearly
   departed.

   Arachne's Web

   A prey caught in a web, shadows move along its edges. Footsteps
   approach. Many, many footsteps. A huge creature emerges, half spider,
   half woman, followed by countless spiders both big and small. She
   welcomes her prey, clearly revelling in the prey's sticky situation.
   The prey knows its over, but not before Arachne's had her fun. It will
   be a long and agonizing end.
   [kitsune.jpg]

   Attack

   A song of the rush of adrenaline during battle, the drums of impending
   doom, and the looming grasp of death.
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Awaiting A Valkyrie

   The battle is fought and death was glorious. With ax in hand the
   valkyries will surely be upon you soon. Life was rough, but
   magnificent. The home you love will surely be missed, and those left
   behind might not all make it to Valhalla. The realization is bitter,
   but the Valkyries will bring you to the eternal halls as promised and
   within them you shall feast among the gods and all hurt and pain will
   be but a distant memory.

   Balance

   A song of inner peace, tranquility, and a sense of calm.
   [orc.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]
   [googleplay.png]

   Battle of Chiefs

   Power is everything to orcs and the only way to gain more is by
   defeating warchiefs for their share of it. Two chiefs enter, only one
   tends to leave, but everyone wins. The victor gains more power, the
   spectators a spectacle, and the defeated warchief gets to die honorably
   in a blaze of glory.
   [oni.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]
   [googleplay.png]

   Battle Rush

   As the battle rages on and the tides begin to turn evermore into your
   favor, the rush of adrenaline and fear turns to one of bloodlust and
   joy. This battle can be won, these enemies can be vanquished, you can
   destroy them all!
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Bifröst

   From far away the bifröst seems like a glimmering spectacle of a path
   fit only for the gods. You can only imagine what it must be like to
   traverse it. Moving further and further from home and deeper and deeper
   into the loneliness of space. But each step further away from home is a
   step closer to the gods, a step closer to the realm of glory and
   unimaginable magnificence. Perhaps one day you'll catch a glimpse of
   it.

   Bittersweet

   Everything comes to an end sooner or later, but few things leave us
   with a feeling of contentment when their end comes. The sadness of an
   end can overpower the feelings of joy and the precious memories we can
   still enjoy, and when we do enjoy those moments they're often
   bittersweet to say the least.
   [wendigo.jpg]

   Blood sacrifice

   A song of growing and growing chants, louder and louder drums, the
   impending doom of what awaits at the end.
   [phoenix.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]

   Breaking Through

   Two armies battle, soldier after soldier falls on both sides, and for a
   while it seems to be an even match. Adrenaline and fear dominate the
   battlefield, but particularly skilled, or perhaps simply lucky,
   soldiers manage to break up the ranks of their enemies. A chance for
   victory, fear is replaced with hope, hope of making it out alive, but
   the battle is far from over.

   Broken Cogs

   Life on the street is difficult even for an automaton. Without
   maintenance the elements gradually chip away at the little cogs and
   wheels within, and the lack of fresh oil prevents everything from
   moving as smoothly as it once did. The future looks most grim and
   uncertain at this hour.
   [arachne.jpg]

   Burn Down Their Homes

   Eye for an eye is the spider's motto and they've got plenty to spare.
   Over and over again they watched as humans burned down their webs and
   eradicated all traces of their homes. Now it's time to turn the tables
   and give those two-legged monsters what they deserve.
   [wendigo.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]
   [googleplay.png]

   Burn to Ashes

   The night horizon glows orange, a blazing fire rages in the distance.
   The torches of monsters set everything ablaze. Slowly the inferno
   creeps closer, burning everything in its path. Fields of crops, homes
   and villages, forests once lush and green, the livelihood and memories
   of countless people. Only soot and ash will remain.

   Caught in a web

   You're stuck. Twelve hellish furies, you're stuck. The more you move,
   the more you get yourself stuck in their tenacious webs. Stay calm and
   think for a moment, there must be a way out. Too late, they're coming.
   More and more of them, big ones, small ones, huge ones too. They're
   crawling all of you. Not a moment is wasted before they begin to wrap
   you in a cocoon. Hundreds of furry legs eagerly prepare you, their
   meal, and soon all that's left is a creepy darkness. The sounds of
   their crawling still audible through the cocoon, but that will end soon
   enough too.

   Carpet of Snow

   As you sit huddled up in a comfy chair by the crackling fire, a cup of
   body warming chocolate milk between your hands and your eyes staring
   through the window at the vast landscape beyond snow starts falling
   every so slightly at first. It doesn't take long before it intensifies
   and all the land becomes covered in a thick layer of fresh snow that
   lights up what seems like the entire world.

   Charge!

   The horns sound the incoming cavalry, the chaos of battle, and the
   turning of tides. More horns, incoming reinforcements. The tides turn
   again.

   A song inspired by the terrible feeling of being followed, but in a
   more dramatic and terrifying fashion.

   Children of the Forest

   Even in the deepest center of the elves' town, countless creatures dart
   and dash their way from branch to branch, bush to bush, and through
   homes and shops without a care in the world. The young elves take great
   pleasure in chasing the small forest bunnies, the young deer and the
   stumbling owlets. The older elves simply enjoy the spectacle from a

   City of Monsters

   Deep within the darkest shadows exists a city of creatures unseen by
   most. Creatures big and small, furry and slimy, and everything in
   between, the city of monsters is home to all those who relish in the
   fear they strike in the hearts of men.

   Clashing Armies

   The horns of war echo through the air. Two armies charge for one
   another, and with a clash of swords, spears, shields, and screams they
   meet. Battle shouts quickly turn to screams of terror and lust for
   blood, countless arrows fly from one side to the other, and a stampede
   of a cavalry comes in from the side. The battle rages on, it's
   impossible to tell who will lose the most, but that's about the last
   thing on the minds of those caught in the midst of it.

   Company of Stars

   Endless space and an eternal darkness, yet around you is nothing but
   light from stars too distant to reach. They light your path as if
   inviting you to visit them, unfortunately you cannot. Your mission
   takes you elsewhere, though far away it still lies. But until you reach
   your destination, the company of stars is a one you gladly keep.

   Up your legs and up your wall
   Run you may, escape you can't

   In tiny legs you'll surely drown
   Surrounded now from floor to ceiling
   To the spider queen you will be kneeling

   Crumbling City

   Sanded stones and wind beaten pillars of a once mighty wall now grant

   When a clan of vampires descends upon a town, there's no running and

   Melancholia

   What was supposed to be an exciting hunt for the next unwilling blood
   donor turned into a melancholic trip down memory lane. An unfortunate
   victim turns out to be quite a look-a-like and triggers memories of
   lives past and tragedies of old. This victim will live, for now.

   Memories

   A song inspired by the bittersweet feelings felt when reminiscing about
   the past, longing for those amazing moments you had, but knowing you'll
   never have those exact moments again. At least there's always moments
   to be had in the future. ^.^

   Metamorphosis

   You fight the urge to drink the blood of the innocent, but the more you
   fight, the more you feel a change within you. The thirst starts to
   manifest itself in the form of a true monster as your veins pulse with
   a creepy energy, one that immediately begins to change your very being.
   Your hands grow longer and gnarly, twisted claws grow from your finger
   nails. Your back arcs forward as two leathery wings sprout from
   nowhere. Your irises disappear as your eyes grow and turn milky, and
   your visage turns elongated and thin. This is your true vampiric form,
   the true monster within you.

   Moment of Solitude

   Once in a while a calm moment of reflection serves as a perfect way to
   clear your mind. Watching the world go by from a simple leaf drifting
   in the wind to the currents of a nearby creek take its waters to a sea
   far beyond the horizon, it's a great way to connect with the world and
   disconnect from whatever may trouble your mind at any given moment.

   Monkey Kingdom

   When the sun is out and the fruits are ripe, the monkey tribe hangs out

   Moonrise

   As the sun sinks lower and lower behind the horizon, the forest grows
   darker and darker. It seems to go quiet, peaceful even as animals begin
   to prepare for their nightly slumber, but soon a whole different kind
   of life begins to awaken. As soon as the sun makes way for the moon,
   countless flowers open up and turn their crowns toward the sky.
   Nocturnal creatures of all sizes can be seen and heard all around, and
   the forest itself comes to life with a luminescent energy.

   New Beginnings

   What may start as a single, simple seed can grow into a vast oasis of

   race toward the light and spread their leaves to take full advantage of

   utmost importance and will determine whether these seedlings will join
   their ancient siblings high up in the canopy or whether they will

   A song inspired by the longing for winter, fueled by the first sparkles
   of frost on the ground, the crisp, cold winds, and the thing layer of
   white created by the fields of frozen dew.

   Wonders of Space

   Looking out into the distant infinity you can see much of the beauty
   space has to offer. Galaxies far, far away shine bright and may be home
   to countless beings, supernovae shine bright and stand out in a last
   show of existence. Black holes offer eerie sights of light and dark,
   and so much more beyond everything in sight.

   Yesteryearning (Instrumental)

   A song inspired by the feeling of yearning for the past, for
   yesteryear. A bittersweet feeling. This version is an instrumental
   version, and thus without the vocal track.

Fantasy music

   Below you'll find a huge range of royalty free music made by me. I'm
   not that great at it, so don't expect professionally crafted music, I'm
   still learning. But it is free to use, to some extent anyway. For more
   information on how you can and cannot use it, click here.
   I love creating music, so there will be more songs in the future,
   probably one every week.

   You can download my music on Soundcloud using the links below each
   song.

   A New Hunger

   A coldness descends from your neck down your entire body. With every
   breath you take you can feel the humanity leaving you. Your skin grows
   colder and whiter, you feel a creeping sensation in your mouth as fangs
   grow longer, and your heart pumps faster and faster in a frenzied panic
   until it stops beating at all. All that is left is a cold shell and an
   insatiable hunger for blood.
   [felineFamiliar.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Abra-Cat-Abra

   Prey caught fresh and bowl of milk. Eye of newt and spider's silk. Brew
   for hours until mid-night, to fill it with a wondrous fright.
   [oni.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Adrenaline Rush

   The battle rages and the tides are in your favor. Enemy after enemy
   falls before your blade and wave after wave of adrenaline rushes
   through your vein as if waging a battle of their own.
   [phoenix.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]

   Anticipation

   Heart's racing, blood's pumping, adrenaline's coursing through every
   vein. Soon the moment of truth will be upon you, but all you can do for
   now is wait in anticipation.
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Approaching Hel

   The path to the dead is long and treacherous, but one that could be
   taken by both gods and mortals seeking to bring back a loved one from
   their untimely end. Yet the most dangerous part of all lies at the end
   of your journey: bargaining with Hel to reclaim the soul of your dearly
   departed.

   Arachne's Web

   A prey caught in a web, shadows move along its edges. Footsteps
   approach. Many, many footsteps. A huge creature emerges, half spider,
   half woman, followed by countless spiders both big and small. She
   welcomes her prey, clearly revelling in the prey's sticky situation.
   The prey knows its over, but not before Arachne's had her fun. It will
   be a long and agonizing end.

   Attack

   A song of the rush of adrenaline during battle, the drums of impending
   doom, and the looming grasp of death.
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Awaiting A Valkyrie

   The battle is fought and death was glorious. With ax in hand the
   valkyries will surely be upon you soon. Life was rough, but
   magnificent. The home you love will surely be missed, and those left
   behind might not all make it to Valhalla. The realization is bitter,
   but the Valkyries will bring you to the eternal halls as promised and
   within them you shall feast among the gods and all hurt and pain will
   be but a distant memory.

   Balance

   A song of inner peace, tranquility, and a sense of calm.

   [googleplay.png]

   Battle of Chiefs

   Power is everything to orcs and the only way to gain more is by
   defeating warchiefs for their share of it. Two chiefs enter, only one
   tends to leave, but everyone wins. The victor gains more power, the
   spectators a spectacle, and the defeated warchief gets to die honorably
   in a blaze of glory.
   [oni.jpg]

   [googleplay.png]

   Battle Rush

   As the battle rages on and the tides begin to turn evermore into your
   favor, the rush of adrenaline and fear turns to one of bloodlust and
   joy. This battle can be won, these enemies can be vanquished, you can
   destroy them all!
   [valkyrie.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [itunes.png] [googleplay.png]

   Bifröst

   From far away the bifröst seems like a glimmering spectacle of a path
   fit only for the gods. You can only imagine what it must be like to
   traverse it. Moving further and further from home and deeper and deeper
   into the loneliness of space. But each step further away from home is a
   step closer to the gods, a step closer to the realm of glory and
   unimaginable magnificence. Perhaps one day you'll catch a glimpse of
   it.

   Bittersweet

   Everything comes to an end sooner or later, but few things leave us
   with a feeling of contentment when their end comes. The sadness of an
   end can overpower the feelings of joy and the precious memories we can
   still enjoy, and when we do enjoy those moments they're often
   bittersweet to say the least.
   [wendigo.jpg]

   Blood sacrifice

   A song of growing and growing chants, louder and louder drums, the
   impending doom of what awaits at the end.
   [phoenix.jpg]

   Breaking Through

   Two armies battle, soldier after soldier falls on both sides, and for a
   while it seems to be an even match. Adrenaline and fear dominate the
   battlefield, but particularly skilled, or perhaps simply lucky,
   soldiers manage to break up the ranks of their enemies. A chance for
   victory, fear is replaced with hope, hope of making it out alive, but
   the battle is far from over.

   Broken Cogs

   Life on the street is difficult even for an automaton. Without
   maintenance the elements gradually chip away at the little cogs and
   wheels within, and the lack of fresh oil prevents everything from
   moving as smoothly as it once did. The future looks most grim and
   uncertain at this hour.

   Burn Down Their Homes

   Eye for an eye is the spider's motto and they've got plenty to spare.
   Over and over again they watched as humans burned down their webs and
   eradicated all traces of their homes. Now it's time to turn the tables
   and give those two-legged monsters what they deserve.
   [wendigo.jpg]
   [youtube.png] [soundcloud.png] [fanburst.png] [itunes.png]

   Burn to Ashes

   The night horizon glows orange, a blazing fire rages in the distance.
   The torches of monsters set everything ablaze. Slowly the inferno
   creeps closer, burning everything in its path. Fields of crops, homes
   and villages, forests once lush and green, the livelihood and memories
   of countless people. Only soot and ash will remain.

   Caught in a web

   You're stuck. Twelve hellish furies, you're stuck. The more you move,
   the more you get yourself stuck in their tenacious webs. Stay calm and
   think for a moment, there must be a way out. Too late, they're coming.
   More and more of them, big ones, small ones, huge ones too. They're
   crawling all of you. Not a moment is wasted before they begin to wrap
   you in a cocoon. Hundreds of furry legs eagerly prepare you, their
   meal, and soon all that's left is a creepy darkness. The sounds of
   their crawling still audible through the cocoon, but that will end soon
   enough too.

   Carpet of Snow

   As you sit huddled up in a comfy chair by the crackling fire, a cup of
   body warming chocolate milk between your hands and your eyes staring
   through the window at the vast landscape beyond snow starts falling
   every so slightly at first. It doesn't take long before it intensifies
   and all the land becomes covered in a thick layer of fresh snow that
   lights up what seems like the entire world.

   The horns sound the incoming cavalry, the chaos of battle, and the
   turning of tides. More horns, incoming reinforcements. The tides turn

   Children of the Forest

   Even in the deepest center of the elves' town, countless creatures dart
   and dash their way from branch to branch, bush to bush, and through
   homes and shops without a care in the world. The young elves take great
   pleasure in chasing the small forest bunnies, the young deer and the
   stumbling owlets. The older elves simply enjoy the spectacle from a
   hopefully safe distance.

   City of Monsters

   Deep within the darkest shadows exists a city of creatures unseen by

   Clashing Armies

   The horns of war echo through the air. Two armies charge for one
   another, and with a clash of swords, spears, shields, and screams they
   meet. Battle shouts quickly turn to screams of terror and lust for
   blood, countless arrows fly from one side to the other, and a stampede
   of a cavalry comes in from the side. The battle rages on, it's
   impossible to tell who will lose the most, but that's about the last
   thing on the minds of those caught in the midst of it.

   Company of Stars

   Endless space and an eternal darkness, yet around you is nothing but
   light from stars too distant to reach. They light your path as if
   inviting you to visit them, unfortunately you cannot. Your mission

   your destination, the company of stars is a one you gladly keep.

   Up your legs and up your wall
   Run you may, escape you can't

   When a clan of vampires descends upon a town, there's no running and

   in a line with countless other mechanical beings. Huge, round beings
   with gigantic drums, smaller ones like him, except with a long,
   trumpet-like nose they were holding with both hands, and countless
   more. But before he had the time to take them all in, the big ones
   started to bang their drums, and everybody started moving as one.
   Whether it was the rhythm or some sort of instinct, the little
   automaton soon started to dance and enjoy himself, perhaps even more so
   than the crowd of people that had gathered to watch this parade. He
   felt like it was as if he was made for this.

   Melancholia

   What was supposed to be an exciting hunt for the next unwilling blood
   donor turned into a melancholic trip down memory lane. An unfortunate
   victim turns out to be quite a look-a-like and triggers memories of
   lives past and tragedies of old. This victim will live, for now.

   Memories

   A song inspired by the bittersweet feelings felt when reminiscing about
   the past, longing for those amazing moments you had, but knowing you'll
   never have those exact moments again. At least there's always moments
   to be had in the future. ^.^

   Metamorphosis

   You fight the urge to drink the blood of the innocent, but the more you
   fight, the more you feel a change within you. The thirst starts to
   manifest itself in the form of a true monster as your veins pulse with
   a creepy energy, one that immediately begins to change your very being.
   Your hands grow longer and gnarly, twisted claws grow from your finger
   nails. Your back arcs forward as two leathery wings sprout from
   nowhere. Your irises disappear as your eyes grow and turn milky, and
   your visage turns elongated and thin. This is your true vampiric form,
   the true monster within you.

   Moment of Solitude

   Once in a while a calm moment of reflection serves as a perfect way to
   clear your mind. Watching the world go by from a simple leaf drifting
   in the wind to the currents of a nearby creek take its waters to a sea
   far beyond the horizon, it's a great way to connect with the world and
   disconnect from whatever may trouble your mind at any given moment.

   Monkey Kingdom

   When the sun is out and the fruits are ripe, the monkey tribe hangs out
   in the trees and fills their bellies with fruity riches. The old take

   swing from tree to tree without a single care in the world.

   Moonrise

   As the sun sinks lower and lower behind the horizon, the forest grows
   darker and darker. It seems to go quiet, peaceful even as animals begin
   to prepare for their nightly slumber, but soon a whole different kind
   of life begins to awaken. As soon as the sun makes way for the moon,
   countless flowers open up and turn their crowns toward the sky.
   Nocturnal creatures of all sizes can be seen and heard all around, and
   the forest itself comes to life with a luminescent energy.

   New Beginnings

   What may start as a single, simple seed can grow into a vast oasis of
   life and splendor. The elves regularly plant such seeds in chosen spots
   and give it time, love, and care when need be to ensure these little
   trees grow into large trees, who in turn offer the right environment
   for other trees, plants, shrubs and animals to grow and thrive.

   Night Infiltration

   A few quick movements in the shadows, noticed by a couple of guards,
   quickly turn into swift strikes leaving the guards unconscious. The

   Seedlings

   As the last of the winter's snow melts, thousands of seedlings awaken
   from their slumber. Protected by the canopies of their elders, they
   race toward the light and spread their leaves to take full advantage of
   its life giving energies. This first season of their lives is of the
   utmost importance and will determine whether these seedlings will join
   their ancient siblings high up in the canopy or whether they will
   perish and return to the soils below.

   little flames lights the thousands of little invaders and a trail from
   fire to hideout. Those who listen closely might hear faint, happy

   An exhausting trek along rocky mountain paths lead you upward and
   upward, further and further toward the top of one of the smaller
   mountains in this range. The higher you get, the more snowflakes you
   see dwindling from the sky, and the more you see your breath in the air
   every time you exhale. You soon reach the top, and as you peek over the
   summit, you're welcomed by a vast landscape of white mountain tops,
   each fed by a constant drift of snow, and all waiting to be climbed
   next.

   Winter Longing

   A song inspired by the longing for winter, fueled by the first sparkles
   of frost on the ground, the crisp, cold winds, and the thing layer of
   white created by the fields of frozen dew.

   Wonders of Space

   Looking out into the distant infinity you can see much of the beauty
   space has to offer. Galaxies far, far away shine bright and may be home
   to countless beings, supernovae shine bright and stand out in a last
   show of existence. Black holes offer eerie sights of light and dark,
   and so much more beyond everything in sight.
