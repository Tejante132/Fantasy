Context – Fantasy

   Fantasy Mindmap:

   Fantasy Mindmap.png

   Here are a bunch of words I associate with the word fantasy. I started
   with words like magic, medieval, heroes as these are words that
   immediately sprung to mind, following this I went with monsters,
   dungeons, and towns as these are some other quite common things found
   in fantasy. With a couple words down on the page I moved onto looking
   at words I could associate with these, like different types of
   monsters, things to do with magic, things you’d find in and around a
   town like a castle, with castle came kings, queens and knights. A lot
   of this I find to be very much related to fantasy but most of all would
   be magic, it is by far one of my favourite things to do with fantasy.
   Magic is a very vast subject with many different types and forms. Magic
   has sprung a whole load of different films, books, games, pictures,
   music, it’s very closely linked to all media as you have a wide option
   as to what you want to do.

   Tomes Moodboard:

   Tomes Moodboard.jpg


   The reason I like these images of tomes as a collective is that they
   all show different styles of designs on the covers as they could have
   just been a large book. This is the kind of thing I would like to
   include in my fantasy environment, which would probably be the common
   shade of green shown above as it’s the most traditional along with the
   gold to create various detail and designs on the front.

   Bows Moodboard:

   Bows Moodboard.png

   These  bows appealed to me as I like the level of appendages on each
   bow to give it a more grand and special look to it as opposed to a more
   standard bow which doesn’t look all that interesting. As a collective I
   like the colours that are used for example the oranges, blues, golds,
   and yellows. A lot of the images here display bird like features which
   is another thing that really appealed to me and if I were to include a
   bow in my environment I would do this myself.

   Gargoyles Moodboard:

   Gargoyles Moodboard.png

   Gargoyles have always been a fascinating aspect of gothic architecture
   due to its many different and unique forms. I like the visuals of these
   gargoyles as they all display a level of demonic aura which makes for a
   ominous grin of deceit. This is something that if I were to include a
   gargoyle into my work would be an aspect of which I’d aspire to
   achieve.

   Rings Moodboard:

   Rings Moodboard.png

   Here are a selection of images showing rings. I like these rings
   because they have a very mystical look to them, with the intricate
   designs and the effective use of jewels they look like magical rings
   which have been a feature in games featuring magic for a long time,
   that being if they give a buff or if they cast a spell either one is
   used frequently. I quite like the idea of having a ring in my diorama
   if it were to be a magical study or a wizards cabin, or even just in a
   cave, on the ground as treasure to be found.

   Crystals Moodboard:

   Crystals Moodboard.png

   I like the idea of having crystals in a fantasy environment, especially
   if it were to be a crystal cave like scene showing different bright
   magically crystals in a undisturbed place, a secret abode for fairies
   and pixies maybe. If I were to have crystals I’d make them a variety of
   different colours not just purple and blue, the reason I chose these
   images is that I like the shapes of them and could use them in my idea,
   I also like the density of each one maybe with smaller crystals being
   in larger swarms and larger crystals being on their own.

   Caves Moodboard:

   Caves Moodboard.png Here are some images of caves, the reason I chose
   these images is that I like the way they depicted a cave. I am quite
   inspired to create a diorama of a magic cave, as previously shown I
   would like it to be a crystal cave as it sounds really interesting to
   me. I would model it after the last two images which show the crystals
   lighting up the cave and creating a nice ambient light. The variety of
   shapes will be greatly increased when I do it as I’d like to have
   different types of crystal clusters. Despite saying I’d use different
   colours I do quite like the purple blue colour scheme as it contrasts
   nicely.
