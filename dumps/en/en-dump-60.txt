       Donte Jackson LAC CB

Chargers' Donte Jackson: Exits game with ankle injury
       5m ago
       Jackson (ankle) is questionable to return to Sunday's game against
       the Broncos.
       Jackson had to be helped off the field after sustaining an ankle
       injury and couldn't put much weight on his leg, per Daniel Popper
       of The Athletic. Deane Leonard and Benjamin St-Juste are in line
       for more snaps in the secondary for as long as Jackson is out of
       the game.

       Trevor Lawrence JAC QB

Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence: Leads Jags to division crown
       5m ago
       Lawrence completed 22 of 30 passes for 255 yards, three touchdowns
       and no interceptions in Sunday's 41-7 win over the Titans. He added
       two rushes for 11 yards.
       Lawrence helped the Jaguars clinch the AFC South with minimal
       drama, leading three touchdown drives in the first half. He
       completed each with a throwing score, coming from 23, seven and
       five yards, respectively, before being pulled with around 11
       minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. While the Titans were a
       particularly soft matchup, Lawrence has finished the regular season
       in strong form -- accounting for multiple touchdowns in seven
       consecutive games. He'll now turn his attention to the postseason,
       with the Jaguars guaranteed a top-three seed in the AFC.

       Channing Tindall ARI LB

Cardinals' Channing Tindall: Dealing with knee injury
       6m ago
       Tindall (knee) is questionable to return to Sunday's contest
       against the Rams, Josh Weinfuss of ESPN.com reports.
       Tindall sustained the injury in the first quarter, and his status
       for the rest of the game is now in question. The linebacker
       operates primarily as a special-teams asset, so his absence doesn't
       carry any impact on defense for Arizona.

       Audric Estime NO RB

Saints' Audric Estime: Plays workhorse role in loss
       7m ago
       Estime rushed 21 times for 63 yards and brought in all five targets
       for 43 yards in the Saints' 19-17 loss to the Falcons on Sunday.
       With Alvin Kamara (knee) sidelined once again to close out the
       season, Estime easily paced the Saints' ground attack in carries
       and rushing yards for a second straight week. The second-year pro
       was much less efficient than during his 14-carry, 94-yard
       performance against the Titans in Week 17, but Estime helped make
       up for it with an impressive day as a pass catcher. Estime put some
       good play on tape over the last two games, and with Kamara's future
       uncertain, it's possible Estime enters the final year of his deal
       with New Orleans in position to compete for significant playing
       time in 2026.

       Bijan Robinson ATL RB

Falcons' Bijan Robinson: Bottled up in season-ending win
       13m ago
       Robinson rushed 15 times for 33 yards and brought in all three
       targets for 10 yards in the Falcons' 19-17 win over the Saints on
       Sunday.
       Fresh off a memorable 195-yard effort on the ground against the
       Rams on Monday night, Robinson was stonewalled by a Saints defense
       that had frequently been vulnerable to the run over the course of
       the season. Robinson's yardage tally on the ground was his lowest
       since Week 8, but despite Sunday's downturn, the 2023 first-round
       pick finished the 2025 campaign with a career-high 1,478 rushing
       yards, seven rushing touchdowns and a career-best 79-820-4
       receiving line while playing in all 17 games for the second
       consecutive season.

       Ty Summers CHI LB

Bears' Ty Summers: Carted off field with foot injury
       20m ago
       Summers (foot) is questionable to return to Sunday's game against
       the Lions.
       Per Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune, Summers injured his foot
       during the opening kickoff. The injury was severe enough for
       Summers to be carted off the field, and while he's considered
       questionable to return, it's more likely that he will be sidelined
       the rest of the way. He has served solely on special teams this
       season, so his absence wouldn't impact the Bears' rotation on
       defense.

       Paul DeJong WAS 3B

Yankees' Paul DeJong: Receives MiLB deal from Yankees
       7h ago
       DeJong agreed Sunday with the Yankees on a minor-league contract
       that includes an invitation to spring training, Jon Heyman of the
       New York Post reports.
       DeJong latches on with New York for his age-32 season after
       spending the 2025 campaign with the Nationals. The veteran
       infielder played in just 57 games due to a nose and eye injury that
       stemmed from being hit in the face by a pitch. He finished the
       season with a .228/269/.373 slash line to go with six home runs, 23
       RBI, 18 runs scored and four stolen bases across 208 plate
       appearances. The Yankees already have ample infield depth, but
       DeJong will get the chance to compete for a utility role in spring
       training. If he's added to the Yankees' 26-man active roster at any
       point, DeJong will earn $1 million, per Mark Feinsand of MLB.com.

       Orlando Arcia COL 3B

Twins' Orlando Arcia: Signs minors deal with Twins
       1d ago
       Arcia signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Saturday,
       Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
       Arcia endured his worst season in the big leagues last year,
       slashing .202/.238/.291 with 13 RBI and 13 runs scored across 214
       plate appearances between Atlanta and Colorado. The 31-year-old
       will have a chance to bounce back in the Twins' farm system, but he
       likely won't act as more than bench depth if he makes it back to
       the majors in 2026.

       Kaleb Ort HOU RP

Astros' Kaleb Ort: Dropped from 40-man
       2d ago
       The Astros designated Ort (elbow) for assignment Friday, Chandler
       Rome of The Athletic reports.
       Ort posted a 4.89 ERA and 1.35 WHIP across 46 innings with the
       Astros in 2025 before missing the final month of the season due to
       elbow inflammation. He'll now lose his place on Houston's 40-man
       roster to make room for Tatsuya Imai.

       Ryan Fitzgerald MIN 3B

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster
       2d ago
       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

       Eric Wagaman MIN 1B

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       2d ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. Wagaman sported a .283/.321/.462 batting line
       against lefties in 2025, so much of his playing time in Minnesota
       could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Won't be limited to DH in 2026
       2d ago
       Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said earlier this month that Fry
       (face) is expected to resume playing defense during the 2026
       season, Tim Stebbins of MLB.com reports. "I'm just excited that
       David is going to be healthy," Vogt said. "David having a full
       winter, healthy, completed the [throwing] rehab. It's going to be
       really exciting to be able to use him the way his skill set is
       intended."
       After undergoing Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow last
       November, Fry was cleared to make his 2025 debut for the Guardians
       in late May but ended being limited exclusively to
       designated-hitter and pinch-hitting duties throughout the season.
       His campaign came to an early end when he was hit in the face by a
       pitch from the Tigers' Tarik Skubal on Sept. 23, resulting in Fry
       requiring surgery to repair nasal fractures. Vogt suggested that
       Fry has fully healed from that procedure, putting the 30-year-old
       on track to resume duties as the team's third catch while also
       being in the mix for playing time at the infield and outfield
       corners in 2026. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had a .996 OPS
       against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to the
       Guardians, who ranked 27th against left-handers in 2025 with a .647
       OPS.

       Cade Cunningham DET SG

Pistons' Cade Cunningham: Scores 27 points inefficiently
       5m ago
       Cunningham generated 27 points (7-22 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 11-11 FT), six
       rebounds, seven assists, two steals and one block across 37 minutes
       of Sunday's 114-110 win over the Cavaliers.
       Cunningham went cold from the field, knocking down just 31.8
       percent of his attempts. However, his ability to consistently get
       to the free throw line allowed him to eclipse the 25-point
       threshold for a fifth straight game. During that stretch, he's
       averaging 28.2 points, 11.0 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 2.6 combined
       steals-plus-blocks.

Wizards' Kyshawn George: No timeline for return
       9m ago
       Head coach Brian Keefe told reporters that George -- who will not
       play Sunday against the Timberwolves due to a left hip flexor
       strain -- is doing some on-court work but does not have a clear
       timeline for a return, Josh Robbins of The Athletic reports.
       George's absence Sunday marks the fifth consecutive game he'll miss
       due to a hip injury. The lack of a recovery timeline is of concern,
       but his prolonged absence means Tre Johnson should remain in the
       Wizards' starting lineup for as long as the former is sidelined. As
       a starter in Washington's last four games, Johnson has averaged
       16.0 points, 2.3 assists, 2.0 rebounds, 3.3 threes and 1.0 steals
       over 26.8 minutes per game.

       Cavaliers' 114-110 loss to the Pistons on Sunday.
       Mitchell scored 23 of his 30 points in the second half of Sunday's
       loss and finished as the game's leading scorer. The All-Star guard
       has scored at least 30 points in three consecutive games and in 20
       of 34 regular-season games. Over his last 15 outings, Mitchell has
       averaged 29.6 points, 5.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 3.7 threes and 1.6
       steals over 33.2 minutes per game.

Heat's Nikola Jovic: Available to play
       24m ago
       Jovic (groin) is available for Sunday's game against the Pelicans.
       Jovic will power through the groin issue, and with both Tyler Herro
       (toe) and Jaime Jaquez (ankle) missing in action, Jovic should see
       quality minutes in the rotation. Over the past five games, Jovic
       has averaged 14.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.2
       triples per contest.

Heat's Pelle Larsson: Available to play
       32m ago
       Larsson (ankle) is available for Sunday's game versus the Pelicans,
       Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.
       Larsson is back after a two-game stint on the sidelines, and with
       Tyler Herro (toe) not expected to play and Jaime Jaquez (ankle)
       out, Larsson could see quality minutes in Sunday's game. Larsson is
       averaging 15.0 points, 4.3 boards, 5.3 assists and 1.8 triples per
       36 minutes this season.

Heat's Tyler Herro: Not expected to play Sunday
       36m ago
       Herro (toe) will be listed as "available" for Sunday's game versus
       the Pelicans, but he's not expected to play, Ira Winderman of the
       South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.
       Per Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald, head coach Erik Spoelstra
       explained the decision to list Herro as active without the
       intention of playing him Sunday: "He's been putting in a lot of
       work. He's getting closer. This is just more to get the mindset
       ready for the next step. He'll be traveling with us, but he's still
       day-to-day. I don't have an exact date when he'll be ready." It's
       unclear if Herro will be able to play Tuesday in Minnesota, but
       he's getting close. Pelle Larsson (ankle) should get some extended
       run Sunday with Herro and Jaime Jaquez (ankle) unavailable.

Avalanche's Scott Wedgewood: Gets both of back-to-back
       21m ago
       Wedgewood will start Sunday's contest at the Panthers, Corey
       Masisak of The Denver Post reports.
       One night after stopping 25 of the 28 shots he faced against the
       Hurricanes, Wedgewood will start against the Panthers as well. The
       33-year-old is riding a personal five-game winning streak, but this
       is the first time that he's started both games of a back-to-back
       this season. The Panthers are coming off of a 5-1 defeat in the
       Winter Classic against the Rangers, the team's third loss in their
       last four games.

       22m ago
       Toews (upper body) isn't expected to play against Florida on
       Sunday, Corey Masisak of The Denver Post reports.
       Toews managed to return to Saturday's 5-3 win over Carolina after
       crashing into the end boards, but he will miss at least one game.
       He has produced one goal, 12 assists, 68 shots on net and 58
       blocked shots across 40 appearances this season. With Toews
       unavailable, Ilya Solovyov will play against the Panthers on
       Sunday.

Sharks' Alexander Wennberg: Inks three-year extension
       1h ago
       Wennberg signed a three-year, $18 million contract extension with
       San Jose on Sunday.
       Wennberg has accounted for seven goals, 26 points, 47 shots on net
       and 52 blocked shots across 41 appearances this season. He has been
       a versatile middle-six forward for the organization since signing a
       two-year, $10 million deal with the Sharks in July of 2024.

Panthers' Daniil Tarasov: Taking on the Avs
       2h ago
       Tarasov will start Sunday's contest against the Avalanche, Jordan
       McPherson of the Miami Herald reports.
       Tarasov will get his first start of 2026 against the league-leading
       Avalanche. The 26-year-old is 4-6-2 with a 2.96 GAA and an .899
       save percentage as the number two goaltender behind Sergei
       Bobrovsky. The Avalanche come in on the second of a back-to-back
       but are owners of the league's best offense (4.08 goals per game).

Capitals' Trevor van Riemsdyk: Records assist Saturday
       3h ago
       Van Riemsdyk notched an assist in Saturday's 3-2 shootout loss to
       the Blackhawks.
       Van Riemsdyk ended a nine-game point drought with the helper. He
       was also scratched three times in that span. The 34-year-old still
       gets a majority of the playing time in a third-pairing role, but
       he'll occasionally sit out to allow Declan Chisholm or Dylan
       McIlrath a chance to play. Van Riemsdyk is at six points, 18 shots
       on net, 43 blocked shots, 12 PIM and a minus-3 rating over 32
       appearances.

Capitals' Ryan Leonard: Forces overtime Saturday
       3h ago
       Leonard scored a goal on three shots and added two hits in
       Saturday's 3-2 shootout loss to the Blackhawks.
       Leonard has earned a goal and four assists over six games since he
       returned from a shoulder injury. The 20-year-old could get a boost
       in usage if Tom Wilson (lower body) or Aliaksei Protas (lower body)
       miss any additional time. Leonard is up to eight goals, 23 points,
       72 shots on net, 48 hits, 20 PIM and a plus-8 rating through 35
       appearances, mainly in a third-line role. Leonard is now fourth in
       rookie points, trailing Ivan Demidov (35), Beckett Sennecke (31)
       and Matthew Schaefer (28).

Packers' Chris Brooks: Leading rusher in loss
       3m ago
       Brooks carries the ball 13 times for 61 yards in Sunday's 16-3 loss
       to the Vikings.
       The No. 3 running back on the Green Bay depth chart saw his most
       extensive action of the season as the team rested Josh Jacobs
       (knee/ankle) ahead of the playoffs, and Brooks wound up leading the
       Packers in rushing yards despite seeing less volume than Emanual
       Wilson. Brooks came into the game with just 14 carries for 45 yards
       on the season, so he's unlikely to make any kind of impact in the

       Emanuel Wilson GB RB

Packers' Emanuel Wilson: Tough sledding against Vikings
       5m ago
       Wilson carried the ball 18 times for 44 yards and caught his only
       target for four yards in Sunday's 16-3 loss to Minnesota.
       The Packers rested key players ahead of the playoffs, including
       Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle), but Wilson wound up being outgained by
       Chris Brooks out of the backfield as the team deployed a
       ground-heavy attack. Wilson has seen no more than four carries in
       four of the last five games, so he isn't likely to have a big role
       in the wild-card round. The third-year RB wraps up the regular
       season with 496 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 125 carries.

Rams' Jordan Whittington: Leaves game due to knee injury
       6m ago
       Whittington (knee) is questionable to return to Sunday's game
       against the Cardinals.
       Per Adam Grosbard of The Orange County Register, Whittington came
       out of the blue medical tent with a brace on his right knee and was
       testing it out before eventually being taken to the locker room.
       Xavier Smith and Tutu Atwell would be in line for more snaps on
       offense if Whittington is unable to return, and in that scenario,
       Blake Corum would also serve as the Rams' primary returner on
       kickoffs.

       Drake London ATL WR

Falcons' Drake London: Closes out season strong
       7m ago
       London secured four of eight targets for 78 yards and a touchdown
       in the Falcons' 19-17 win over the Saints on Sunday.
       Despite managing his ongoing knee issue, London set the pace for
       the Falcons in receiving yards on the afternoon while checking in
       second in both receptions and targets. The talented wideout also
       added his seventh touchdown catch of the season on a 15-yard grab
       with just over three minutes remaining in the first quarter. London
       was on pace for a career-best season before his injury cost him
       four games, but he still wrapped up his fourth campaign with a
       68-919-7 line across 12 contests while averaging a career-high 13.5
       yards per reception.

       Clayton Tune GB QB

Packers' Clayton Tune: Limited in regular-season finale
       10m ago
       Tune completed six of 11 passes for 34 yards without a touchdowns
       or an interception in Sunday's 16-3 loss to the Vikings. He added
       23 rushing yards on four carries.
       With Jordan Love and Malik Willis (shoulder/hamstring) being held
       out ahead of the playoffs, Tune made his second career NFL start
       but wasn't called upon to do too much, as the Packers focused on
       their ground game. Tune, a fifth-round pick of the Cardinals in
       2023, will likely return to the No. 3 spot on the depth chart in
       the wild-card round next weekend.

       Jackson had to be helped off the field after sustaining an ankle
       injury and couldn't put much weight on his leg, per Daniel Popper
       of The Athletic. Deane Leonard and Benjamin St-Juste are in line
       for more snaps in the secondary for as long as Jackson is out of

Yankees' Paul DeJong: Receives MiLB deal from Yankees
       7h ago
       DeJong agreed Sunday with the Yankees on a minor-league contract
       that includes an invitation to spring training, Jon Heyman of the
       New York Post reports.
       DeJong latches on with New York for his age-32 season after
       spending the 2025 campaign with the Nationals. The veteran
       infielder played in just 57 games due to a nose and eye injury that
       stemmed from being hit in the face by a pitch. He finished the
       season with a .228/269/.373 slash line to go with six home runs, 23
       RBI, 18 runs scored and four stolen bases across 208 plate
       appearances. The Yankees already have ample infield depth, but
       DeJong will get the chance to compete for a utility role in spring
       training. If he's added to the Yankees' 26-man active roster at any
       point, DeJong will earn $1 million, per Mark Feinsand of MLB.com.

Twins' Orlando Arcia: Signs minors deal with Twins
       1d ago
       Arcia signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Saturday,
       Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
       Arcia endured his worst season in the big leagues last year,
       slashing .202/.238/.291 with 13 RBI and 13 runs scored across 214
       plate appearances between Atlanta and Colorado. The 31-year-old
       will have a chance to bounce back in the Twins' farm system, but he
       likely won't act as more than bench depth if he makes it back to
       the majors in 2026.

       Ort posted a 4.89 ERA and 1.35 WHIP across 46 innings with the
       Astros in 2025 before missing the final month of the season due to
       elbow inflammation. He'll now lose his place on Houston's 40-man

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster

       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       2d ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. Wagaman sported a .283/.321/.462 batting line
       against lefties in 2025, so much of his playing time in Minnesota
       could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Won't be limited to DH in 2026
       2d ago
       Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said earlier this month that Fry
       (face) is expected to resume playing defense during the 2026
       season, Tim Stebbins of MLB.com reports. "I'm just excited that
       David is going to be healthy," Vogt said. "David having a full
       winter, healthy, completed the [throwing] rehab. It's going to be
       really exciting to be able to use him the way his skill set is
       intended."
       After undergoing Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow last
       November, Fry was cleared to make his 2025 debut for the Guardians
       in late May but ended being limited exclusively to
       designated-hitter and pinch-hitting duties throughout the season.
       His campaign came to an early end when he was hit in the face by a
       pitch from the Tigers' Tarik Skubal on Sept. 23, resulting in Fry
       requiring surgery to repair nasal fractures. Vogt suggested that
       Fry has fully healed from that procedure, putting the 30-year-old
       on track to resume duties as the team's third catch while also
       being in the mix for playing time at the infield and outfield
       corners in 2026. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had a .996 OPS
       against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to the
       Guardians, who ranked 27th against left-handers in 2025 with a .647
       OPS.

Pistons' Cade Cunningham: Scores 27 points inefficiently
       12m ago
       Cunningham generated 27 points (7-22 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 11-11 FT), six
       rebounds, seven assists, two steals and one block across 37 minutes
       of Sunday's 114-110 win over the Cavaliers.
       Cunningham went cold from the field, knocking down just 31.8
       percent of his attempts. However, his ability to consistently get
       to the free throw line allowed him to eclipse the 25-point
       threshold for a fifth straight game. During that stretch, he's
       averaging 28.2 points, 11.0 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 2.6 combined
       steals-plus-blocks.

Wizards' Kyshawn George: No timeline for return
       17m ago
       Head coach Brian Keefe told reporters that George -- who will not
       play Sunday against the Timberwolves due to a left hip flexor
       strain -- is doing some on-court work but does not have a clear
       timeline for a return, Josh Robbins of The Athletic reports.
       George's absence Sunday marks the fifth consecutive game he'll miss
       due to a hip injury. The lack of a recovery timeline is of concern,
       but his prolonged absence means Tre Johnson should remain in the
       Wizards' starting lineup for as long as the former is sidelined. As
       a starter in Washington's last four games, Johnson has averaged
       16.0 points, 2.3 assists, 2.0 rebounds, 3.3 threes and 1.0 steals
       over 26.8 minutes per game.

       rebounds, three assists and three steals over 33 minutes during the

       Mitchell scored 23 of his 30 points in the second half of Sunday's
       loss and finished as the game's leading scorer. The All-Star guard
       has scored at least 30 points in three consecutive games and in 20
       of 34 regular-season games. Over his last 15 outings, Mitchell has
       averaged 29.6 points, 5.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 3.7 threes and 1.6

       Per Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald, head coach Erik Spoelstra

       ready for the next step. He'll be traveling with us, but he's still
       day-to-day. I don't have an exact date when he'll be ready." It's
       unclear if Herro will be able to play Tuesday in Minnesota, but
       he's getting close. Pelle Larsson (ankle) should get some extended
       run Sunday with Herro and Jaime Jaquez (ankle) unavailable.

       Christopher Brooks GB RB

Packers' Chris Brooks: Leading rusher in loss
       7m ago
       Brooks carries the ball 13 times for 61 yards in Sunday's 16-3 loss
       to the Vikings.
       The No. 3 running back on the Green Bay depth chart saw his most
       extensive action of the season as the team rested Josh Jacobs
       (knee/ankle) ahead of the playoffs, and Brooks wound up leading the
       Packers in rushing yards despite seeing less volume than Emanual
       Wilson. Brooks came into the game with just 14 carries for 45 yards
       on the season, so he's unlikely to make any kind of impact in the
       wild-card round.

       Emanuel Wilson GB RB

Packers' Emanuel Wilson: Tough sledding against Vikings
       10m ago
       Wilson carried the ball 18 times for 44 yards and caught his only
       target for four yards in Sunday's 16-3 loss to Minnesota.
       The Packers rested key players ahead of the playoffs, including
       Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle), but Wilson wound up being outgained by
       Chris Brooks out of the backfield as the team deployed a
       ground-heavy attack. Wilson has seen no more than four carries in
       four of the last five games, so he isn't likely to have a big role
       in the wild-card round. The third-year RB wraps up the regular
       season with 496 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 125 carries.

       Jordan Whittington LAR WR

Rams' Jordan Whittington: Leaves game due to knee injury
       11m ago
       Whittington (knee) is questionable to return to Sunday's game
       against the Cardinals.
       Per Adam Grosbard of The Orange County Register, Whittington came
       out of the blue medical tent with a brace on his right knee and was
       testing it out before eventually being taken to the locker room.
       Xavier Smith and Tutu Atwell would be in line for more snaps on
       offense if Whittington is unable to return, and in that scenario,
       Blake Corum would also serve as the Rams' primary returner on
       kickoffs.

       Drake London ATL WR

Falcons' Drake London: Closes out season strong
       11m ago
       London secured four of eight targets for 78 yards and a touchdown
       in the Falcons' 19-17 win over the Saints on Sunday.
       Despite managing his ongoing knee issue, London set the pace for
       the Falcons in receiving yards on the afternoon while checking in
       second in both receptions and targets. The talented wideout also
       added his seventh touchdown catch of the season on a 15-yard grab
       with just over three minutes remaining in the first quarter. London
       was on pace for a career-best season before his injury cost him
       four games, but he still wrapped up his fourth campaign with a
       68-919-7 line across 12 contests while averaging a career-high 13.5
       yards per reception.

       Clayton Tune GB QB

Packers' Clayton Tune: Limited in regular-season finale
       14m ago
       Tune completed six of 11 passes for 34 yards without a touchdowns
       or an interception in Sunday's 16-3 loss to the Vikings. He added
       23 rushing yards on four carries.
       With Jordan Love and Malik Willis (shoulder/hamstring) being held
       out ahead of the playoffs, Tune made his second career NFL start
       but wasn't called upon to do too much, as the Packers focused on
       their ground game. Tune, a fifth-round pick of the Cardinals in
       2023, will likely return to the No. 3 spot on the depth chart in
       the wild-card round next weekend.

Chargers' Donte Jackson: Exits game with ankle injury

       Jackson (ankle) is questionable to return to Sunday's game against
       the Broncos.
       Jackson had to be helped off the field after sustaining an ankle
       injury and couldn't put much weight on his leg, per Daniel Popper
       of The Athletic. Deane Leonard and Benjamin St-Juste are in line
       for more snaps in the secondary for as long as Jackson is out of
       the game.

       Paul DeJong WAS 3B

Yankees' Paul DeJong: Receives MiLB deal from Yankees
       7h ago
       DeJong agreed Sunday with the Yankees on a minor-league contract
       that includes an invitation to spring training, Jon Heyman of the
       New York Post reports.
       DeJong latches on with New York for his age-32 season after
       spending the 2025 campaign with the Nationals. The veteran
       infielder played in just 57 games due to a nose and eye injury that
       stemmed from being hit in the face by a pitch. He finished the
       season with a .228/269/.373 slash line to go with six home runs, 23
       RBI, 18 runs scored and four stolen bases across 208 plate
       appearances. The Yankees already have ample infield depth, but
       DeJong will get the chance to compete for a utility role in spring
       training. If he's added to the Yankees' 26-man active roster at any
       point, DeJong will earn $1 million, per Mark Feinsand of MLB.com.

       Orlando Arcia COL 3B

Twins' Orlando Arcia: Signs minors deal with Twins
       1d ago
       Arcia signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Saturday,
       Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
       Arcia endured his worst season in the big leagues last year,
       slashing .202/.238/.291 with 13 RBI and 13 runs scored across 214
       plate appearances between Atlanta and Colorado. The 31-year-old
       will have a chance to bounce back in the Twins' farm system, but he
       likely won't act as more than bench depth if he makes it back to
       the majors in 2026.

       Kaleb Ort HOU RP

Astros' Kaleb Ort: Dropped from 40-man
       2d ago
       The Astros designated Ort (elbow) for assignment Friday, Chandler
       Rome of The Athletic reports.
       Ort posted a 4.89 ERA and 1.35 WHIP across 46 innings with the
       Astros in 2025 before missing the final month of the season due to
       elbow inflammation. He'll now lose his place on Houston's 40-man
       roster to make room for Tatsuya Imai.

       Ryan Fitzgerald MIN 3B

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster
       2d ago
       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

       Eric Wagaman MIN 1B

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       2d ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. Wagaman sported a .283/.321/.462 batting line
       against lefties in 2025, so much of his playing time in Minnesota
       could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Won't be limited to DH in 2026
       2d ago
       Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said earlier this month that Fry
       (face) is expected to resume playing defense during the 2026
       season, Tim Stebbins of MLB.com reports. "I'm just excited that
       David is going to be healthy," Vogt said. "David having a full
       winter, healthy, completed the [throwing] rehab. It's going to be
       really exciting to be able to use him the way his skill set is
       intended."
       After undergoing Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow last
       November, Fry was cleared to make his 2025 debut for the Guardians
       in late May but ended being limited exclusively to
       designated-hitter and pinch-hitting duties throughout the season.
       His campaign came to an early end when he was hit in the face by a
       pitch from the Tigers' Tarik Skubal on Sept. 23, resulting in Fry
       requiring surgery to repair nasal fractures. Vogt suggested that
       Fry has fully healed from that procedure, putting the 30-year-old
       on track to resume duties as the team's third catch while also
       being in the mix for playing time at the infield and outfield
       corners in 2026. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had a .996 OPS
       against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to the
       Guardians, who ranked 27th against left-handers in 2025 with a .647
       OPS.

Hawks' Trae Young: Still out
       4m ago
       Young (quadriceps) won't play in Monday's game against the Raptors,
       Brad Rowland of the Locked On Podcast Network reports.
       Young will miss a fifth straight contest due to a bruised right
       quad. He's been ruled out on the initial injury report in
       back-to-back games after landing a questionable tag for Friday's
       contest. The star guard's absence will mean expanded roles for
       Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Vit Krejci and Keaton Wallace. Young's
       next chance to play will come Wednesday against the Pelicans.

       Cade Cunningham DET SG

Pistons' Cade Cunningham: Scores 27 points inefficiently
       16m ago
       Cunningham generated 27 points (7-22 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 11-11 FT), six
       rebounds, seven assists, two steals and one block across 37 minutes
       of Sunday's 114-110 win over the Cavaliers.
       Cunningham went cold from the field, knocking down just 31.8
       percent of his attempts. However, his ability to consistently get
       to the free throw line allowed him to eclipse the 25-point
       threshold for a fifth straight game. During that stretch, he's
       averaging 28.2 points, 11.0 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 2.6 combined
       steals-plus-blocks.

Wizards' Kyshawn George: No timeline for return
       21m ago
       Head coach Brian Keefe told reporters that George -- who will not
       play Sunday against the Timberwolves due to a left hip flexor
       strain -- is doing some on-court work but does not have a clear
       timeline for a return, Josh Robbins of The Athletic reports.
       George's absence Sunday marks the fifth consecutive game he'll miss
       due to a hip injury. The lack of a recovery timeline is of concern,
       but his prolonged absence means Tre Johnson should remain in the
       Wizards' starting lineup for as long as the former is sidelined. As
       a starter in Washington's last four games, Johnson has averaged
       16.0 points, 2.3 assists, 2.0 rebounds, 3.3 threes and 1.0 steals
       over 26.8 minutes per game.

Cavaliers' Donovan Mitchell: Another 30-point performance
       27m ago
       Mitchell logged 30 points (10-21 FG, 3-10 3Pt, 7-9 FT), six
       rebounds, three assists and three steals over 33 minutes during the
       Cavaliers' 114-110 loss to the Pistons on Sunday.
       Mitchell scored 23 of his 30 points in the second half of Sunday's
       loss and finished as the game's leading scorer. The All-Star guard
       has scored at least 30 points in three consecutive games and in 20

       36m ago
       Jovic (groin) is available for Sunday's game against the Pelicans.
       Jovic will power through the groin issue, and with both Tyler Herro
       (toe) and Jaime Jaquez (ankle) missing in action, Jovic should see
       quality minutes in the rotation. Over the past five games, Jovic
       has averaged 14.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.2
       triples per contest.

       5m ago
       Beecher (upper body) received a one-game suspension from the NHL
       Department of Player Safety on Sunday for roughing Nashville's
       Michael McCarron on Saturday.
       Beecher won't be eligible to play in Monday's matchup against
       Seattle because of the suspension. However, he could miss
       additional time after serving the one-game ban after suffering an
       injury in Saturday's 4-3 loss to the Predators.

Avalanche's Gavin Brindley: In Sunday lineup
       12m ago
       Brindley (lower body) will play Sunday against the Panthers,
       according to the NHL Media site.
       Brindley was injured during Wednesday's 6-1 victory over the Blues
       and missed Saturday's contest against the Hurricanes as a result.
       It will be just a one game absence for the 21-year-old as he is set
       to return for Sunday's battle with the Panthers. He has registered
       nine points (five goals, four assists) in 27 games played.

Avalanche's Scott Wedgewood: Gets both of back-to-back
       33m ago
       Wedgewood will start Sunday's contest at the Panthers, Corey
       Masisak of The Denver Post reports.
       One night after stopping 25 of the 28 shots he faced against the
       Hurricanes, Wedgewood will start against the Panthers as well. The
       33-year-old is riding a personal five-game winning streak, but this
       is the first time that he's started both games of a back-to-back
       this season. The Panthers are coming off of a 5-1 defeat in the
       Winter Classic against the Rangers, the team's third loss in their
       last four games.

Avalanche's Devon Toews: Unavailable Sunday
       33m ago
       Toews (upper body) isn't expected to play against Florida on
       Sunday, Corey Masisak of The Denver Post reports.
       Toews managed to return to Saturday's 5-3 win over Carolina after
       crashing into the end boards, but he will miss at least one game.
       He has produced one goal, 12 assists, 68 shots on net and 58
       blocked shots across 40 appearances this season. With Toews
       unavailable, Ilya Solovyov will play against the Panthers on
       Sunday.

       Wennberg signed a three-year, $18 million contract extension with
       San Jose on Sunday.

       and 52 blocked shots across 41 appearances this season. He has been

Panthers' Daniil Tarasov: Taking on the Avs
       2h ago
       Tarasov will start Sunday's contest against the Avalanche, Jordan
       McPherson of the Miami Herald reports.
       Tarasov will get his first start of 2026 against the league-leading
       Avalanche. The 26-year-old is 4-6-2 with a 2.96 GAA and an .899
       save percentage as the number two goaltender behind Sergei
       Bobrovsky. The Avalanche come in on the second of a back-to-back
       but are owners of the league's best offense (4.08 goals per game).

       CeeDee Lamb DAL WR

Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb: Fewest yards since 2020
       3m ago
       Lamb caught his only target for four yards in Sunday's 34-17 loss
       to the Giants. He finishes the 2025 season with 75 catches for
       1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets.
       Lamb posted the lowest touchdown total of his career and his fewest
       receiving yards since his 935-yard rookie regular season in 2020,
       as he was overshadowed by George Pickens' 93-1,423-9 receiving line
       in Dallas' receiving corps. The 26-year-old Lamb's 14 games played
       in 2025 were also a career low. Lamb is locked in with Dallas,
       having signed a four-year, $136 million extension in August of
       2024, while Pickens is expected to re-sign with the team in the
       offseason. Despite boasting one of the league's best wide receiver
       duos, the Cowboys missed the playoffs with a 7-9-1 record.

       Jordan Mason MIN RB

Vikings' Jordan Mason: Productive in Week 18
       4m ago
       Mason carried the ball 14 times for 94 yards in Sunday's 16-3 win
       over the Packers.
       With Aaron Jones (hip) ruled out for the Vikings' regular-season
       finale, Mason led the backfield with his best yardage total since
       Week 3. Fullback C.J. Ham vultured a one-yard TD run in the second
       quarter, however. Mason finishes his first season in Minnesota with
       758 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 159 carries, and with both
       Jones and Mason on affordable contracts in 2026, the duo will
       likely remain in some form of timeshare next season.

       Tyler Shough NO QB

Saints' Tyler Shough: Strong finish to rookie campaign
       4m ago
       Shough completed 23 of 35 passes for 259 yards with one touchdown
       and one interception while rushing three times for 34 yards and
       another score in the Saints' 19-17 loss to the Falcons on Sunday.
       Shough was able to head into the offseason with yet another
       encouraging outing, capping off a second half of the season where
       the 2025 second-round pick cemented himself as the Saints' starter
       heading into 2026. Shough opened New Orleans' scoring with a
       one-yard run late in the second quarter, and he went on to add a
       16-yard scoring toss with just over a minute remaining that
       featured a nifty one-handed catch from Ronnie Bell. Shough finished
       his rookie season having completed 67.6 percent of his passes for
       2,384 yards and a 10:6 TD:INT while adding a 45-186-3 rushing line
       across 11 games.

       Pickens caught one of three targets for nine yards in Sunday's
       34-17 loss to the Giants. He finishes the 2025 season with 93
       catches for 1,423 yards and nine touchdowns on 137 targets.
       Pickens didn't add much to his career high totals in catches,
       receiving yards and touchdowns before the Cowboys took out their
       key offensive starters at halftime. The 24-year-old wide receiver
       is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason, though
       the Cowboys are expected to retain Pickens, either through an
       extension or with the franchise tag. Pickens posted the best season
       of his career after being acquired from the Steelers in an
       offseason trade, but Dallas failed to reach the playoffs with a
       7-9-1 record.

       Dak Prescott DAL QB

Cowboys' Dak Prescott: Throws for 4,552 yards in 2025
       7m ago
       Prescott completed seven of 11 passes for 70 yards and rushed twice
       for minus-1 yard, in addition to losing a fumble, in Sunday's 34-17
       loss to the Giants. He finishes the 2025 season with 4,552 passing
       yards and a 30:10 TD:INT.
       Prescott came into the regular-season finale with the most passing
       yards, completions and pass attempts in the NFL. With the Cowboys
       eliminated from playoff contention, he didn't add much to those
       totals before being replaced by backup Joe Milton at halftime.
       Prescott is set to carry a cap hit slightly north of $74 million in
       2026, but the Cowboys have little choice but to stick with the
       32-year-old quarterback despite the team's lack of playoff success.

Broncos' Alex Forsyth: Dealing with ankle issue
       9m ago
       Forsyth (ankle) is questionable to return to Sunday's contest
       against the Chargers, Zac Stevens of TheDNVR.com reports.
       Forsyth suffered an ankle injury in the first half, and his status
       for the rest of the game is now in doubt. In his absence, Sam
       Mustipher has taken over at center versus Los Angeles.

       Paul DeJong WAS 3B

Yankees' Paul DeJong: Receives MiLB deal from Yankees
       7h ago
       DeJong agreed Sunday with the Yankees on a minor-league contract
       that includes an invitation to spring training, Jon Heyman of the
       New York Post reports.
       DeJong latches on with New York for his age-32 season after
       spending the 2025 campaign with the Nationals. The veteran
       infielder played in just 57 games due to a nose and eye injury that
       stemmed from being hit in the face by a pitch. He finished the
       season with a .228/269/.373 slash line to go with six home runs, 23
       RBI, 18 runs scored and four stolen bases across 208 plate
       appearances. The Yankees already have ample infield depth, but
       DeJong will get the chance to compete for a utility role in spring
       training. If he's added to the Yankees' 26-man active roster at any
       point, DeJong will earn $1 million, per Mark Feinsand of MLB.com.

       Orlando Arcia COL 3B

Twins' Orlando Arcia: Signs minors deal with Twins
       1d ago
       Arcia signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Saturday,
       Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
       Arcia endured his worst season in the big leagues last year,
       slashing .202/.238/.291 with 13 RBI and 13 runs scored across 214
       plate appearances between Atlanta and Colorado. The 31-year-old
       will have a chance to bounce back in the Twins' farm system, but he
       likely won't act as more than bench depth if he makes it back to
       the majors in 2026.

       The Astros designated Ort (elbow) for assignment Friday, Chandler
       Rome of The Athletic reports.
       Ort posted a 4.89 ERA and 1.35 WHIP across 46 innings with the
       Astros in 2025 before missing the final month of the season due to
       elbow inflammation. He'll now lose his place on Houston's 40-man
       roster to make room for Tatsuya Imai.

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster
       2d ago
       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       2d ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. Wagaman sported a .283/.321/.462 batting line
       against lefties in 2025, so much of his playing time in Minnesota
       could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Won't be limited to DH in 2026
       2d ago
       Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said earlier this month that Fry
       (face) is expected to resume playing defense during the 2026
       season, Tim Stebbins of MLB.com reports. "I'm just excited that
       David is going to be healthy," Vogt said. "David having a full
       winter, healthy, completed the [throwing] rehab. It's going to be
       really exciting to be able to use him the way his skill set is
       intended."
       After undergoing Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow last
       November, Fry was cleared to make his 2025 debut for the Guardians
       in late May but ended being limited exclusively to
       designated-hitter and pinch-hitting duties throughout the season.
       His campaign came to an early end when he was hit in the face by a
       pitch from the Tigers' Tarik Skubal on Sept. 23, resulting in Fry
       requiring surgery to repair nasal fractures. Vogt suggested that
       Fry has fully healed from that procedure, putting the 30-year-old
       on track to resume duties as the team's third catch while also
       being in the mix for playing time at the infield and outfield
       corners in 2026. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had a .996 OPS
       against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to the
       Guardians, who ranked 27th against left-handers in 2025 with a .647
       OPS.

       Queen (quadriceps) is available for Sunday's game against the Heat.
       Queen has been cleared to return from a one-game absence due to a
       left quadriceps contusion, so Yves Missi will likely revert to a
       bench role for Sunday's contest. Queen is averaging 13.1 points,

       Kennard missed the closing half of a back-to-back set Saturday due
       to back soreness, and he's at risk of missing Monday's contest as
       well. With Trae Young (quadriceps) out, Kennard's absence would
       leave the Hawks shorthanded in the backcourt.

       against the Raptors, Brad Rowland of the Locked On Podcast Network
       reports.
       Porzingis missed Atlanta's previous game -- the second leg of a
       back-to-back -- but he'll be good to go Monday. He's appeared in
       two games since returning from a 10-game absence due to illness,
       and he's come off the bench and played 17 minutes in both outings.
       While he'll still be under heavy limitations Monday, he may see an
       extra minute or two.

       Oubre was recently cleared for full-contact, 5-on-5 work, which is

       Brindley was injured during Wednesday's 6-1 victory over the Blues

       It will be just a one game absence for the 21-year-old as he is set

       One night after stopping 25 of the 28 shots he faced against the

Broncos' Alex Forsyth: Returns to Sunday's game
       5m ago
       Forsyth (ankle) has returned to Sunday's game against the Chargers,
       Zac Stevens of TheDNVR.com reports.
       Forsyth briefly left Sunday's game due to an ankle injury, but he's
       back in the game at center after being cleared by medical staff to
       return. Sam Mustipher is on stand by to reenter the game if Forsyth

       Justin Jefferson MIN WR

Vikings' Justin Jefferson: Extends 1,000-yard season streak
       5m ago
       Jefferson caught eight of 11 targets for 101 yards in Sunday's 16-3
       win over the Packers.
       It's been a tough season for Jefferson due to the Vikings' issues
       at quarterback, but with his first 100-yard performance since Week
       5, the superstar wideout was able to record his sixth straight
       1,000-yard campaign to begin his career. Jefferson wraps up the
       year with an 84-1,048-2 line on 141 targets, the worst yardage and
       TD totals of his career, and one of Minnesota's biggest priorities
       this offseason will be finding a way to build chemistry between
       J.J. McCarthy (hand) and his most talented target.

       Jaydon Blue DAL RB

Cowboys' Jaydon Blue: Caps poor rookie year on high note
       6m ago
       Blue rushed 16 times for 64 yards and a touchdown but wasn't
       targeted in the passing game during Sunday's 34-17 loss to the
       Giants.
       Blue spent most of his rookie season as a healthy inactive, but he
       took on the lead back role in the regular-season finale as the
       Cowboys played without Javonte Williams (shoulder) and Malik Davis
       (eye/calf). Blue made the most of his opportunity, scoring his
       first NFL touchdown on a 14-yard run in the first quarter. The 2025
       fifth-round pick will try to carve out a larger role in his second
       NFL campaign after dressing for only five games as a rookie. Blue
       had 38 carries for 129 yards and one touchdown while catching his
       only target for five yards across those five appearances.

       CeeDee Lamb DAL WR

Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb: Fewest yards since 2020
       8m ago
       Lamb caught his only target for four yards in Sunday's 34-17 loss
       to the Giants. He finishes the 2025 season with 75 catches for
       1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets.
       Lamb posted the lowest touchdown total of his career and his fewest
       receiving yards since his 935-yard rookie regular season in 2020,
       as he was overshadowed by George Pickens' 93-1,423-9 receiving line
       in Dallas' receiving corps. The 26-year-old Lamb's 14 games played
       in 2025 were also a career low. Lamb is locked in with Dallas,
       having signed a four-year, $136 million extension in August of
       2024, while Pickens is expected to re-sign with the team in the
       offseason. Despite boasting one of the league's best wide receiver
       duos, the Cowboys missed the playoffs with a 7-9-1 record.

       Jordan Mason MIN RB

Vikings' Jordan Mason: Productive in Week 18
       8m ago
       Mason carried the ball 14 times for 94 yards in Sunday's 16-3 win
       over the Packers.
       With Aaron Jones (hip) ruled out for the Vikings' regular-season
       finale, Mason led the backfield with his best yardage total since
       Week 3. Fullback C.J. Ham vultured a one-yard TD run in the second
       quarter, however. Mason finishes his first season in Minnesota with
       758 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 159 carries, and with both
       Jones and Mason on affordable contracts in 2026, the duo will
       likely remain in some form of timeshare next season.

       Tyler Shough NO QB

Saints' Tyler Shough: Strong finish to rookie campaign
       9m ago
       Shough completed 23 of 35 passes for 259 yards with one touchdown
       and one interception while rushing three times for 34 yards and
       another score in the Saints' 19-17 loss to the Falcons on Sunday.
       Shough was able to head into the offseason with yet another
       encouraging outing, capping off a second half of the season where
       the 2025 second-round pick cemented himself as the Saints' starter
       heading into 2026. Shough opened New Orleans' scoring with a
       one-yard run late in the second quarter, and he went on to add a
       16-yard scoring toss with just over a minute remaining that
       featured a nifty one-handed catch from Ronnie Bell. Shough finished
       his rookie season having completed 67.6 percent of his passes for
       2,384 yards and a 10:6 TD:INT while adding a 45-186-3 rushing line
       across 11 games.

       Paul DeJong WAS 3B

Yankees' Paul DeJong: Receives MiLB deal from Yankees
       7h ago
       DeJong agreed Sunday with the Yankees on a minor-league contract
       that includes an invitation to spring training, Jon Heyman of the
       New York Post reports.
       DeJong latches on with New York for his age-32 season after
       spending the 2025 campaign with the Nationals. The veteran
       infielder played in just 57 games due to a nose and eye injury that
       stemmed from being hit in the face by a pitch. He finished the
       season with a .228/269/.373 slash line to go with six home runs, 23
       RBI, 18 runs scored and four stolen bases across 208 plate
       appearances. The Yankees already have ample infield depth, but
       DeJong will get the chance to compete for a utility role in spring
       training. If he's added to the Yankees' 26-man active roster at any
       point, DeJong will earn $1 million, per Mark Feinsand of MLB.com.

       Orlando Arcia COL 3B

Twins' Orlando Arcia: Signs minors deal with Twins
       1d ago
       Arcia signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Saturday,
       Chris Cotillo of MassLive.com reports.
       Arcia endured his worst season in the big leagues last year,
       slashing .202/.238/.291 with 13 RBI and 13 runs scored across 214
       plate appearances between Atlanta and Colorado. The 31-year-old
       will have a chance to bounce back in the Twins' farm system, but he
       likely won't act as more than bench depth if he makes it back to
       the majors in 2026.

       Kaleb Ort HOU RP

Astros' Kaleb Ort: Dropped from 40-man
       2d ago
       The Astros designated Ort (elbow) for assignment Friday, Chandler
       Rome of The Athletic reports.
       Ort posted a 4.89 ERA and 1.35 WHIP across 46 innings with the
       Astros in 2025 before missing the final month of the season due to
       elbow inflammation. He'll now lose his place on Houston's 40-man
       roster to make room for Tatsuya Imai.

       Ryan Fitzgerald MIN 3B

Twins' Ryan Fitzgerald: Booted off 40-man roster
       2d ago
       The Twins designated Fitzgerald for assignment Friday.
       The transaction clears a spot on the 40-man roster for the addition
       of Eric Wagaman, who was acquired via trade. Fitzgerald reached the
       majors for the first time in 2025 shortly before turning 31,
       finishing with a .196/.302/.457 batting line with four home runs in
       24 games for the Twins. He's a versatile defender, which could mean
       there will be interest in Fitzgerald on waivers.

       Eric Wagaman MIN 1B

Twins' Eric Wagaman: Traded to Minnesota
       2d ago
       The Twins acquired Wagaman from the Marlins on Friday in exchange
       for Kade Bragg.
       Wagaman had been designated for assignment earlier this week and is
       now on the move to a new club. The 28-year-old slashed
       .250/.296/.378 with nine home runs across 140 games for the Marlins
       this season and is capable of handling the corner infield and
       outfield spots. Wagaman sported a .283/.321/.462 batting line
       against lefties in 2025, so much of his playing time in Minnesota
       could come versus southpaws.

       David Fry CLE C

Guardians' David Fry: Won't be limited to DH in 2026
       2d ago
       Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said earlier this month that Fry
       (face) is expected to resume playing defense during the 2026
       season, Tim Stebbins of MLB.com reports. "I'm just excited that
       David is going to be healthy," Vogt said. "David having a full
       winter, healthy, completed the [throwing] rehab. It's going to be
       really exciting to be able to use him the way his skill set is
       intended."
       After undergoing Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow last
       November, Fry was cleared to make his 2025 debut for the Guardians
       in late May but ended being limited exclusively to
       designated-hitter and pinch-hitting duties throughout the season.
       His campaign came to an early end when he was hit in the face by a
       pitch from the Tigers' Tarik Skubal on Sept. 23, resulting in Fry
       requiring surgery to repair nasal fractures. Vogt suggested that
       Fry has fully healed from that procedure, putting the 30-year-old
       on track to resume duties as the team's third catch while also
       being in the mix for playing time at the infield and outfield
       corners in 2026. Fry's ability to hit lefties -- he had a .996 OPS
       against southpaws in 2024 -- should provide a boost to the
       Guardians, who ranked 27th against left-handers in 2025 with a .647
       OPS.

       Queen (quadriceps) is available for Sunday's game against the Heat.
       Queen has been cleared to return from a one-game absence due to a

       bench role for Sunday's contest. Queen is averaging 13.1 points,

       Since Murphy only missed one game, he shouldn't be operating with

       Kenard (back) is listed as questionable for Monday's game against

       Kennard missed the closing half of a back-to-back set Saturday due
       to back soreness, and he's at risk of missing Monday's contest as
       well. With Trae Young (quadriceps) out, Kennard's absence would
       leave the Hawks shorthanded in the backcourt.

       Porzingis (illness) isn't on the injury report for Monday's game
       against the Raptors, Brad Rowland of the Locked On Podcast Network
       reports.
       Porzingis missed Atlanta's previous game -- the second leg of a
       back-to-back -- but he'll be good to go Monday. He's appeared in
       two games since returning from a 10-game absence due to illness,
       and he's come off the bench and played 17 minutes in both outings.
       While he'll still be under heavy limitations Monday, he may see an
       extra minute or two.

       Oubre was recently cleared for full-contact, 5-on-5 work, which is
       often the last step in the rehab process. While Oubre won't play
       Monday, he does appear to be close, so perhaps he'll be able to get

       there was no update on his status following the contest, Lia

       Benn fell awkwardly in the third period, and his face went hard

Avalanche's Scott Wedgewood: Gets both of back-to-back
       1h ago
       Wedgewood will start Sunday's contest at the Panthers, Corey
       Masisak of The Denver Post reports.
       One night after stopping 25 of the 28 shots he faced against the
       Hurricanes, Wedgewood will start against the Panthers as well. The
       33-year-old is riding a personal five-game winning streak, but this
       is the first time that he's started both games of a back-to-back
       this season. The Panthers are coming off of a 5-1 defeat in the
       Winter Classic against the Rangers, the team's third loss in their
       last four games.

       1h ago
       Toews (upper body) isn't expected to play against Florida on

       blocked shots across 40 appearances this season. With Toews
       unavailable, Ilya Solovyov will play against the Panthers on
