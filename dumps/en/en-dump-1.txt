   What did Mariah Carey say about "Fantasy"? (BUTTON)
   Genius Answer
   (BUTTON) 3 contributors

     I had the melody idea for ‘Fantasy’ and I was listening to the radio
     and heard ‘Genius of Love,’ and I hadn’t heard it in a long time. It
     reminded me of growing up and listening to the radio and that
     feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea
     I had for ‘Fantasy.’ I initially told [co-writer] Dave Hall about
     the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were
     really into it.
