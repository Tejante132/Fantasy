How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.

How to Write Fantasy Novels: Definition, Tips, and How to Publish

   by
   Jason Hamilton

   Updated Sep 30, 2025

   Free collection: author tools

   I’ve been working at Kindlepreneur for some time, and I love to write
   nonfiction articles for authors. But my first love is writing fantasy.

   Which is why I was excited when we decided to write this article.

   Now, this article is just one in a series of articles about how to
   write in various genres, but I knew that I had to claim this one before
   anyone else could.
   Here’s what you’ll learn in this article:
    1. Why you should write fantasy
    2. How to find your audience
    3. Where to even start
    4. How to build a plot
    5. How to develop fantasy characters
    6. How to world build

   Let’s dive in.

Why Write Fantasy?

   This is actually a question I’ve asked myself a number of times.
   Because, for a lot of people, fantasy can feel intimidating. It’s hard
   enough writing about the real world, much less create an entirely new
   one that needs to feel consistent.

   But that said, here are a few reasons that I love to write fantasy, and
   why you might too:
     * Amazing for the imagination: Fantasy frees you from the limitations
       of the real world. Here, dragons fly and wizards cast spells.
       Create entirely new worlds with their own rules.
     * Wide appeal: Fantasy has a massive, dedicated following. From
       Tolkien fans to young adult fantasy aficionados, the market is
       substantial.
     * Escapism: In stressful times, both writers and readers appreciate
       an escape. Fantasy offers a break from the mundane, the tragic, or
       the stressful.
     * Dig into rich archetypes: Fantasy is ripe for using universal
       symbols and archetypes, like the hero's journey, to tap into shared
       human experiences.
     * Franchise-building: Think Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Fantasy
       series lend themselves well to adaptations—films, TV shows, video
       games, merchandise.
     * Inspiration: Your tales of heroism and magical realms can serve as
       a powerful form of inspiration and empowerment.
     * It’s just fun!: Last but not least, writing fantasy is fun. If you
       enjoy reading it, odds are you'll love writing it too.

   So assuming you want to write fantasy (and I’m guessing you do if
   you’ve read this far), let’s dig into the steps to do so.

Step 1: Find Your Audience First

   The first step with any genre, but especially in fantasy, is to figure
   out WHO you are writing for.

   Don’t skip this part, it’s important.

   Here are a few things you should do to get to know your audience as
   best you can:
     * Understand the niche genre: Fantasy is a broad genre with many
       sub-genres—epic, urban, dark, to name a few. Zero in on the niche
       that interests you most. It will give you a sense of direction.
     * Read those books: Don't just stick to the classics. Dive into your
       specific sub-genre. By reading widely, you'll get an idea of what
       already exists and what readers are looking for.
     * Engage in online communities: Search for Facebook groups related to
       your niche. Become an active member. Listen to what people are
       saying, their likes and dislikes, and common themes that arise.
       This will give you invaluable insights into your future readership.
     * Read well-known fantasy authors: While niche reading is crucial,
       don't ignore the titans of the genre. Understand what makes authors
       like J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin successful. Examine their
       storytelling techniques and narrative structures.
     * Understand well-known tropes: Familiarize yourself with recurring
       themes and motifs in fantasy—like the “Chosen One” or the
       “Reluctant Hero.” But remember, tropes aren't bad; it's how you
       make them fresh that counts.

   If you haven’t read a lot of books or understand the tropes that
   readers expect, you can’t expect them to like what you write.

   Yes, it’s possible to bend the rules now and then, but you can’t bend
   them unless you know them thoroughly, enough to really understand where
   and when it’s appropriate to change things up.

Step 2: Start With Setting

   Once you've identified your audience, the next step is choosing a
   setting. This forms the foundation for plot, characters and everything
   that follows. Here are a few tips:
     * Pick a Portal: Do characters from our world travel to a fantasy
       realm through a portal? This instantly connects readers since we
       experience the magical world through the POV of our surrogate
       character. Portals can include mysterious doorways, teleporting
       wardrobes, whirlpools, and more. The portal trope has been a
       fantasy staple since Alice fell through the looking glass.
     * Construct a Whole New World: Or you can build a completely
       fictional world like Middle Earth or Westeros—the ultimate act of
       fantasy creation. This immersive option requires extensive
       worldbuilding since you're constructing a new reality from scratch.
       But total creative freedom makes it highly rewarding.
     * Blend Real and Fantasy: Urban and historical fantasy blend real and
       magical elements. The tensions between the mundane and mystical
       make for resonant fiction. For example, magicians living secretly
       among us regular folk in urban fantasy. Or retelling actual
       historical events with folkloric twists like Naomi Novik's
       Temeraire dragon rider books.
     * Pick a Familiar Starting Spot: Begin in a familiar setting like a
       medieval village, mysterious wilderness or magical academy before
       unfurling more fantastical environments later on. This eases
       readers into your world. Luke lived on a moisture farm before
       heading to wild planets in Star Wars.
     * Make It Personal: Most importantly, choose a fantasy setting that
       resonates with YOU. Tap into your own passions and knowledge like
       Renaissance festivals, antique maps, roleplaying games, etc.

Step 3: Craft a Compelling Fantasy Plot

   Once you've established the setting, you need an equally compelling
   plot. Here are tips for fantasy plots that cast a spell over readers:
     * External Goal/Quest: Fantasy protagonists often embark on an epic
       quest like rescuing a kingdom, recovering a magical artifact,
       overthrowing a dark lord or finding their true destiny. Make sure
       the external stakes are high enough to justify a novel-length
       adventure. Include formidable obstacles and nail-biting climaxes.
     * Internal Conflict: Layer your fantasy quest with internal conflict.
       For example, a heroine must overcome self-doubt and trauma from her
       past to fulfill her destiny. These inner struggles make characters
       relatable. External and internal arcs should interweave seamlessly.
     * Magical or Supernatural Elements: Incorporate fantasy/magical
       aspects organically into the plot. How do they influence or
       complicate the story events? For example, magic gifts may help the
       hero…but also make them reckless and arrogant. The curse that must
       be lifted has unexpected side effects.
     * Subplots and Supporting Arcs: Surround your protagonist with a
       supporting cast whose subplots, motivations and backstories
       interconnect with the main arc.
     * Twists and Reversals: Layer in exciting twists, complications,
       setbacks, discoveries, betrayals and revelations throughout your
       fantasy plot. The path to victory should never run smooth. Shake
       things up to maintain suspense.
     * Blend Genres: While pure fantasy is engaging, blending in other
       genres like mystery, horror, romance etc can create uniquely
       flavored tales. For example, Naomi Novik's dragon rider books add
       military fiction elements that complement the fantasy foundation.
     * Outline Thoroughly: Fantasy's complexity demands meticulous
       outlining. Map out chapters, scenes, plot points, character arcs
       and more.

Step 4: Create Compelling Fantasy Characters

   Now let's discuss how to people your world with multidimensional
   characters readers will adore.
     * Hero's Journey Archetype: Many fans love stories that echo the
       universal “hero's journey” template. Their structure and emotional
       beats resonate deeply. Key phases include the call to adventure,
       meeting the mentor, crossing threshold, tests/ordeals, seizing the
       sword, resurrection, and return home with elixir.
     * Flawed Heroes: The most relatable fantasy protagonists have flaws,
       quirks or moral ambiguity rather than being generically heroic.
       Give them hot tempers, arrogance, addictions, anxieties, prejudices
       or violent impulses that force them to grow. Readers crave
       imperfect heroes (but not too imperfect).
     * Scene-Stealing Sidekicks: A great fantasy sidekick serves many
       functions: comic relief, voice of reason, protector, confidante,
       and more. They in turn reveal hidden aspects of the protagonist.
       Loyal sidekicks like Samwise Gamgee are reader surrogates along for
       the adventure. Give them unique bonds with the protagonist that tug
       heartstrings.
     * Nuanced Villains: While clearly evil, the best fantasy antagonists
       have complexity instead of being cookie-cutter villains. They have
       empathy-inducing motivations, principles, soft spots, and doubts
       that add nuance. Visceral moral struggles make compelling villains.
     * Supporting Cast: Populate your world with a diverse supporting cast
       representing different fantasy races, personalities, motivations
       and functions in the story. Vary relationships between
       characters—allies, rivals, loved ones etc. Interweave supporting
       arcs that complement the hero's journey.
     * Fantastic Races: From graceful elves to stout dwarves to cunning
       goblins, readers love stories starring classic fantasy races. Or
       invent your own original variations! Either way, construct
       different biology, abilities, cultures, histories, temperaments and
       societal roles for each race. But avoid obvious stereotypes.
     * Magical Companions: Fantasy heroes often have devoted magical
       companions like helpful fairies, wise dragons, loyal griffins or
       quick-witted unicorns. These companions act as guides, transport,
       comic relief and fellow underdogs.
     * Character Arcs: Make sure each major character undergoes an
       emotional arc and transformation by story's end, not just the
       protagonist.

Step 5: Build a Believable Fantasy World

   Perhaps the most challenging yet rewarding aspect of writing fantasy is
   constructing an intricate secondary world. Where do you even start
   inventing a whole reality? Here's my advice:
     * Magic System: A defining aspect of most fantasy worlds is a system
       of magic. Determine its rules, costs, limitations and how it's
       harnessed. Is magic common or rare? Does using it drain life force
       or sanity? Do mages invoke divine powers or manipulate natural
       energies?
     * Races and Creatures: Populate your world with original or
       traditional fantasy races like elves, dwarves etc. Plus invent
       mythical beasts and monsters. Consider their appearances, powers,
       temperaments, societies, histories and how they fit into the world.
       Give each a distinct flair.
     * Moral Alignment: What overarching cosmic principles guide your
       world? Is there objective good vs evil like Middle Earth? Or moral
       relativism like in Game of Thrones where every faction believes
       they're justified.
     * History and Mythology: Invent ancient histories, wars, dynasties,
       prophecies and mythological accounts that provide backstory.
       Timelines span eons.
     * Politics and Factions: Dream up an array of factions, houses,
       orders, guilds, empires and more locked in an intricate web of
       rivalries and uneasy alliances. Detail their philosophies, customs,
       clothing, values, economic interests and subcultures.
     * Languages: Invent unique languages for each race and realm with
       influences from earth languages like Elvish borrowing from Celtic
       tongues.
     * Maps and Geography: Maps allow readers to trace and anticipate the
       adventure. Note major landmarks like wizard towers, monster lairs,
       ruins and kingdoms. How do terrain, climate and natural resources
       impact cultures that arise? Harsh desert clans will differ from
       seafaring islanders.
     * Religion and Spirituality: Is your world polytheistic or
       monotheistic? Do different races worship distinct pantheons?
       Outline core tenets, rituals, clerical ranks and holy sites. Belief
       systems reflect worldviews and values. And religious power
       structures deeply shape societies.
     * Food, Sports, Pastimes and Arts: On a lighter note, have fun
       detailing cultural trivia like beloved epic poems, national
       cuisine, celebrities, fashion trends, industries etc. This adds
       delightful local flavor. Maybe dwarves enjoy underground mushroom
       stew and beetle racing! Go wild with creativity.
     * Start Small: While Tolkien could spend thousands of pages on
       worldbuilding, modern readers often prefer more restrained
       approaches. Start with one village or city as a homebase, then
       expand the world's scope along with the story. Less is often more.

   For more on worldbuilding, see our comprehensive article on the
   subject.

Step 6: Develop Effective Fantasy Writing Habits

   Now for the actual writing! Though inspiration is crucial, dedication
   and self-discipline are what transform ideas into finished manuscripts.
   Here are habits that help:
     * Set a Daily Word Count Goal: Establish a daily word count target
       tailored to your schedule. 500-1000 words per day is reasonable for
       busy folks. Hitting regular incremental targets adds up over time
       better than sporadic long sessions. Track progress to stay
       motivated.
     * Write at the Same Time Daily: Pick a set time and stick to it as
       much as possible to build a habitual routine, especially mornings.
       Writing during your peak energy hours when you're fresh and
       distraction-free sets you up for success.
     * Minimize Internet/Social Media: It's obvious but worth stating:
       turn off the internet to avoid endless distraction sinkholes!
       Disconnect to stay on target.
     * Write Offline: To avoid the lure of internet rabbit holes, one
       method is to write your first draft offline in a basic word
       processor.
     * Try Writing Sprints: Sprints are short timed writing bursts like 25
       minutes where you write without stopping. Take short breaks between
       sprints to recharge. The time pressure turbocharges your word
       count.
     * Write By Hand: Unplug and go old school by writing parts of your
       draft longhand with pen and paper. Our brains engage differently.
     * Outline The Next Chapter: Outlining your next chapter ahead of time
       gives you a roadmap to follow for the writing session. Stick to the
       major story beats and scenes. But leave wiggle room for spontaneous
       inspiration once writing.
     * Timeline and Tracker: Use a timeline and character tracker to
       organize complex story threads. This helps avoid inconsistencies
       and holes. Update these documents as your story evolves. Keeping
       detailed records saves headaches later.
     * Utilize Accountability: Find an accountability partner like your
       critique group or a trusted writer friend to check in on progress.
       Knowing someone is expecting regular updates keeps you on track.
       Better still, write together at coffee shops for camaraderie.

Step 7: Revise and Edit Your Fantasy Novel

   You did it! First draft complete. But lots of work remains to polish
   your diamond-in-the-rough into a dazzling gem ready to publish. Here
   are tips for the editing stage:
     * Developmental editing: Critique and strengthen the high-level
       components like plot, pacing, characters, worldbuilding and voice.
       Fix plot holes, flesh out weak points, cut unnecessary sections,
       and adjust pacing.
     * Line editing: Take passages line-by-line to refine repetitive
       wording, clichés, weak verbs, and awkward phrasing. Inject more
       vivid details and concise language.
     * Copy editing: Scrutinize the manuscript for grammar, spelling,
       punctuation, consistency, accuracy, and formatting issues. Verify
       facts, dates, names are correct.
     * Beta readers: Get feedback from trusted readers on elements that
       need improvement or clarification. Incorporate their diverse
       perspectives.
     * Proofreading: Perform final checks for any typos, formatting
       errors, spacing issues, etc. before publication. Double check all
       names and facts.

Other Fantasy Writing Tips

   Here are some final miscellaneous tips that can help you level up as a
   fantasy writer:
     * Prologues: Prologues are slightly controversial, as some authors
       don’t like having them, but other authors insist they should be
       used. Generally speaking, I recommend using them if you want to set
       up the conflict and tone of the book, and if your chapter 1 doesn’t
       do this on its own (common when starting from the “Ordinary
       World”.)
     * High or Low Fantasy?: High fantasy worlds have pervasive magic. Low
       fantasy settings contain only subtle magical influences. Figure out
       which mode fits your story best. Low magic often sustains more
       tension and sense of wonder when the supernatural is rare.
     * Hard vs. Soft Magic Systems: Hard systems have strictly defined
       rules and limits. Soft is more arbitrary and mysterious. Hard fits
       stories focused on mastering abilities and strategy. Soft suits
       tales emphasizing mysterious wonder.
     * Symbolism Resonance: Layering in recurring motifs and symbols that
       reinforce core themes adds depth. Eternal struggle between
       light/dark, decaying kingdom symbolizing moral decline, etc.
       Enhance resonance.
     * Study Real History and Mythology: History and myths offer endless
       inspiration. Adapt elements like ancient pantheons, lost
       civilizations and military conquests. Research also helps build
       realistic dynamics between fictional races and cultures. Truth
       provides verisimilitude.
     * Steal From The Best: Every great artist stands on the shoulders of
       those before. Don't copy outright, but study and remix ideas from
       fantasies you admire. Masterful classics teach invaluable lessons
       in worldbuilding and storytelling. Let their triumphs inspire your
       own.

   And those are my best tips for writing transportive, sublime fantasy
   fiction! It's an ambitious undertaking, but immensely fulfilling. I
   hope these strategies help you turn the fantastical stories kindling in
   your soul into fully-realized novels.

   Your imagination is the only limit.
