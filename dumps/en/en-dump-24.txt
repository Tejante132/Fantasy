10 Best Young Adult Fantasy Novels You Need to Read

   My Top 10 Young Adult Fantasy Novels

   Young Adult (YA) fantasy is one of the most exciting genres in
   literature, filled with magic, intrigue, and unforgettable characters.
   I read a variety of genres, but Fantasy holds a special place in my
   heart. Whether you love courtly politics, high-stakes heists, or
   magical destinies, there’s a YA fantasy book for you.

   In this post, I explore 10 of the best YA fantasy novels that have
   captured my heart.

   Hey there! Just a heads-up: This post contains affiliate links. This
   means if you click on one of the links and make a purchase, I may earn
   a small commission at no extra cost to you. Your support helps keep
   this blog running, and I genuinely appreciate it. Thank you!

1. The Cruel Prince – Holly Black

   If you love dark fairy tales, political intrigue, and morally gray
   characters, The Cruel Prince is a must-read. Jude, a mortal girl raised
   in the land of the fae, must navigate a world where power is
   everything. Determined to carve out her place, she clashes with the
   cruel and arrogant Prince Cardan. The story is full of backstabbing,
   deception, and slow-burning romance, making it an addictive read.

   This book kicks off The Folk of the Air trilogy, and the stakes get
   higher with each installment. Holly Black masterfully crafts a
   dangerous and enchanting fae world, proving why she’s called the “Queen
   of Faerie.” In full transparency, when I started this series, I had
   difficulty relating to Jude, but it grew on me.
   Check the book on Amazon

2. A Court of Thorns and Roses – Sarah J. Maas

   A mix of fairy tale retelling, romance, and high fantasy, this book
   starts as a loose Beauty and the Beast retelling before expanding into
   a thrilling, action-packed series. Feyre, a mortal huntress, is taken
   to the faerie realm of Prythian as punishment for killing a wolf.
   There, she discovers secrets that could change everything.

   The series evolves into something much grander, with powerful courts,
   magical battles, and romance that will keep you turning the pages. If
   you love steamy romance and fae lore, this one’s for you. I will say
   this series gets better with each book. Book 2 is a jaw-dropping and
   mind-blowing book.

3. An Ember in the Ashes – Sabaa Tahir

   Set in a brutal world inspired by the Roman Empire, An Ember in the
   Ashes follows Laia, a scholar whose family is torn apart by the
   ruthless Martial Empire. Desperate to save her brother, she infiltrates
   the empire’s most elite military school, where she meets Elias, a
   soldier questioning everything he’s been taught.

   This book is packed with intense action, a gripping rebellion, and
   star-crossed romance. Sabaa Tahir delivers a fast-paced, emotional
   journey that continues in an unforgettable series. This author always
   gets to me. She will take your heart, stomp on it, mend it, and destroy
   it again, but you’ll be happy about it.

4. Six of Crows – Leigh Bardugo

   For fans of heist stories, morally gray characters, and found family
   tropes, Six of Crows is a perfect choice. Set in the Grishaverse (the
   same world as Shadow and Bone), the book follows Kaz Brekker, a
   criminal mastermind who assembles a team of outcasts for an impossible
   heist.

   Each character has a rich backstory and personal stakes, making the
   story deeply engaging. The book delivers action, humor, and emotional
   moments, and its sequel, Crooked Kingdom, is just as thrilling. This
   book took some time to hook me, but when it did, it was glued to my
   hands. Check out my review!
   CHECK THIS BOOK ON AMAZON

5. The Merciful Crow – Margaret Owen

   This gritty and unique fantasy novel follows Fie, a member of the
   Crows—a caste that removes and burns plague victims’ bodies in a world
   of rigid social hierarchy. When she is tasked with protecting a runaway
   prince, she must use her wits, magic, and cunning to survive against
   ruthless enemies.

   The book explores class struggles, found family, and dark magic, with a
   fresh and engaging magic system. If you love underdog protagonists and
   rich world-building, this one is for you. This book was everything I
   didn’t know I needed. This magic system was simply amazing. Check out
   my review!

6. Fourth Wing – Rebecca Yarros

   This book took the fantasy world by storm with its mix of dragons,
   deadly competition, and slow-burn romance. Fourth Wing follows Violet
   Sorrengail, who is forced into a brutal war college where she must
   fight for her life to become a dragon rider.

   With intense training sequences, high stakes, and an electrifying
   enemies-to-lovers romance, this book is perfect for fans of The Hunger
   Games and A Court of Thorns and Roses. The world-building is rich, the
   action is nonstop, and the romance? Absolutely swoon-worthy. This book
   was an “I-can’t-stop-reading” type of story that made me think of sleep
   as optional.

7. Fable – Adrienne Young

   If you love pirate adventures, high-seas drama, and survival stories,
   Fable is a must-read. The story follows Fable, a girl abandoned by her
   father on a dangerous island, who must fight to earn her place in a
   ruthless world of traders and thieves.

   With lush descriptions, an independent heroine, and a slow-burn
   romance, this book is an immersive journey that makes you feel like
   you’re sailing the seas alongside Fable. This author is on my auto-buy.
   The world building was rich and captivating. This is nothing short of a
   riveting story that will stay with you. Check out my review!

8. Kingdom of the Wicked – Kerri Maniscalco

   A dark and seductive fantasy filled with witches, demons, and murder
   mysteries, Kingdom of the Wicked follows Emilia, a young witch seeking
   revenge for her sister’s brutal murder. To uncover the truth, she
   summons Wrath, one of the Seven Princes of Hell, and finds herself
   entangled in a dangerous web of secrets and magic.

   This book is perfect for fans of gothic fantasy, enemies-to-lovers
   romance, and morally gray characters. Its atmospheric writing and
   simmering tension make it a thrilling and addictive read. This series
   is such a fun read, engaging your senses and making your head spin with
   all the mysteries. I absolutely loved it.
   CHECK THIS BOOK ON AMAZON

9. Serpent & Dove – Shelby Mahurin

   This book is for fans of witches, enemies-to-lovers romance, and
   action-packed storytelling. Louise (Lou) is a witch hiding in plain
   sight, while Reid is a witch hunter bound by duty. When fate forces
   them into an unexpected marriage, their worlds collide in a battle of
   love and war.

   The chemistry between Lou and Reid is electric, and the book mixes
   humor with dark themes, making it an unforgettable read. The stakes and
   the chemistry are off the charts in this series. I loved this story so
   much.

10. The Inheritance Games – Jennifer Lynn Barnes

   A mix of fantasy, mystery, and thriller, this book follows Avery, a
   teenager who unexpectedly inherits a billionaire’s fortune—on the
   condition that she survives a series of riddles left behind by the
   deceased.

   The book has a Knives Out vibe, with puzzles, secrets, and a compelling
   mystery that keeps you hooked. It’s the perfect mix of intrigue,
   romance, and family drama. The riddles, the intrigues, and the mystery
   made me love this series as much as it made me question my
   intelligence. LOL I loved every minute of it.
