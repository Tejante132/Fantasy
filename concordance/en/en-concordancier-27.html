<tr><td><br>   Robin Hobb’s first appearance on my list (not her last as the next two<br>   trilogies also come from her). Her Farseer trilogy is a classic and a<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   and characterisation are top quality with a great main character in<br>   FitzChivalry Farseer who narrates the trilogy told in the first person,<br>   you are also introduced to Nighteyes one of, if not the best animal<br></td></tr>

Then there is the<br>   Fool, well, what can you say about the Fool, such an ingenious creation<br>   on Hobb’s part and a wonderful character. A quick mention also to<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>   that he gets what he so thoroughly deserves. I can’t praise the first<br>   book Assassin’s Apprentice in this trilogy enough, I’ve read every<br>   other Hobb book because of Fitz’s first book with the exception of her<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   characters and a unique world in the Six Duchies, a masterpiece!<br><br>    The Liveship Traders Trilogy by Robin Hobb:<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>   stories and Hobb again writes a gripping trilogy that pulls you in<br>   whittling away hours as you become engrossed in her world, For me,<br>   Fool’s Errand has one of the most poignant, sad and heartbreaking<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   book. And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke<br>   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly<br>   tear! Another must-read by one of the greats in fantasy Robin Hobb.<br></td></tr>

And, I tell you now blog followers, she even managed to evoke<br>   emotion in me, making this often sarcastic tattooed male shed a manly<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td><br>    The Broken Empire Trilogy by Mark Lawrence:<br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td>    2. The Liar’s Key (2015).<br>    3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016).<br><br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   Broken Empire trilogy was one of my favourite trilogies out there and I<br>   loved Jorg Ancrath, he was so different to any character that I had<br>   read before. And, so it pains me to write it but overall I prefer his<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>   still Snorri but Jalan by the end has some redeeming qualities about<br>   him to. The trilogies end is also just pure Jalan and you have to<br>   smile. This is more accessible then Lawrence’s Broken Empire trilogy<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   lead characters.<br><br>   A review of The Liar’s Key (book 2) can be found !!HERE!! And, a review<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>    3. Lord of Ashes (2015).<br><br>   Another top quality Grimdark trilogy here, that I personally feel is an<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   lists, so it’s getting a place on mine! A dark, well-paced, well<br>   written engaging trilogy with a decent cast of characters who pull you<br>   into their city and their story. A far more detailed overview of the<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>   A fast-paced well-written trilogy revolving around three main<br>   characters (siblings) and their subsequent story arc’s. Monks,<br>   Politicians and a crack commando unit – yay for an A-Team reference in<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   really interesting main sibling characters, set in a richly detailed<br>   world, action-packed, anyone who’s read this will agree, who doesn’t<br>   want to be a Ketteral??  It really has all you could want in a fantasy<br></td></tr>

<tr><td>   the third book is called Queen of Fire, Vaelin is a fella, he would-be<br>   a King so it’s obvious that he isn’t the main character in the story.<br>   I’ve added the trilogy to the list as I believe Blood Song is a great<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   decent read. It’s just a shame that Ryan set such a high standard with<br>   the first book and then failed to match it with the two sequels.<br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td>    2. The Two Towers (1954).<br>    3. The Return of the King (1955).<br><br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   that is The Lord of The Rings. If you haven’t read the books then I am<br>   guessing that you will at least have watched the films, so it’s a name<br>   that you all should be well aware of! Anyone out there not heard of The<br></td></tr>
<tr><td><br>   The Wounded Kingdom has a thriller element running through it with each<br>   book having mysteries that require solving by Girton and in my review<br></td><td><b>fantasy</b></td><td>   perfect blending together of the two genres.<br><br>   Near the end of King of Assassins, the last book in the trilogy you<br></td></tr>
